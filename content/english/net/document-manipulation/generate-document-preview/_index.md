# Generate Document Preview

## Introduction
In the world of digital document management, watermarking plays a crucial role in ensuring the security and authenticity of documents. GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET is a powerful tool that allows developers to add watermarks to documents effortlessly. In this tutorial, we will walk you through the process of generating document previews using GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started, this guide will provide you with a comprehensive step-by-step process to achieve your goal.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the implementation, let's make sure you have everything you need to get started:
- A basic understanding of C# and .NET framework.
- Visual Studio installed on your machine.
- GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET library. You can [download it here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/Watermark/net/).
- A valid license for GroupDocs.Watermark. You can either purchase it [here](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy) or obtain a [temporary license](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/) for evaluation purposes.
## Import Namespaces
To start using GroupDocs.Watermark in your project, you'll need to import the necessary namespaces. This can be done by adding the following using directives to your code:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options;
```
These namespaces will provide access to the classes and methods required for watermarking and generating document previews.

Let's break down the process of generating a document preview into simple, easy-to-follow steps.
## Step 1: Set Up Your Project
First things first, set up your .NET project in Visual Studio. If you don't have a project already, create a new one by following these steps:
1. Open Visual Studio.
2. Click on "Create a new project."
3. Select "Console App (.NET Core)" and click "Next."
4. Name your project and choose a location to save it, then click "Create."
## Step 2: Install GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET
To use GroupDocs.Watermark in your project, you need to install the library. This can be done using NuGet Package Manager:
1. Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer.
2. Select "Manage NuGet Packages."
3. Search for "GroupDocs.Watermark" in the Browse tab.
4. Click "Install" to add the library to your project.
Alternatively, you can install it via the Package Manager Console:
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Watermark
```
## Step 3: Define Document Path and Output Directory
Before generating the preview, you need to specify the path of the document you want to preview and the directory where the preview images will be saved:
```csharp
string documentPath = "Your Document Path";
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
```
Replace "Your Document Path" with the path to your document and "Your Document Directory" with the directory where you want to save the preview images.
## Step 4: Initialize Watermarker Object
Create an instance of the `Watermarker` class by passing the document path to its constructor. This object will be used to perform all watermarking operations:
```csharp
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath))
{
    // Your code here
}
```
## Step 5: Create Delegate Methods for Stream Handling
To generate the preview, you need to define delegate methods for creating and releasing streams. These methods will handle the creation and release of streams for each page of the document:
```csharp
CreatePageStream createPageStreamDelegate = delegate(int number)
{
    string previewImageFileName = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, string.Format("page{0}.png", number));
    return File.OpenWrite(previewImageFileName);
};
ReleasePageStream releasePageStreamDelegate = delegate(int number, Stream stream)
{
    stream.Close();
};
```
The `createPageStreamDelegate` method creates a stream for each page of the document, while the `releasePageStreamDelegate` method closes the stream after the preview is generated.
## Step 6: Configure Preview Options
Next, configure the preview options by creating an instance of the `PreviewOptions` class. Specify the delegate methods and set the preview format to PNG. You can also specify which pages to include in the preview:
```csharp
PreviewOptions previewOptions = new PreviewOptions(createPageStreamDelegate, releasePageStreamDelegate)
{
    PreviewFormat = PreviewOptions.PreviewFormats.PNG,
    PageNumbers = new[] { 1, 2 }
};
```
In this example, we are generating previews for the first two pages of the document.
## Step 7: Generate the Document Preview
Finally, call the `GeneratePreview` method on the `Watermarker` object, passing in the configured `PreviewOptions`. This will generate the preview images and save them to the specified directory:
```csharp
watermarker.GeneratePreview(previewOptions);
```
## Conclusion
Generating document previews using GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET is a straightforward process that can be accomplished with just a few lines of code. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can easily set up your project, configure the necessary options, and generate previews for your documents. This powerful library not only simplifies the watermarking process but also provides robust features for managing and manipulating watermarks.
