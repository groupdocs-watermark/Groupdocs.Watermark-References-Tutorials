# Add Image Watermark from Stream

## Introduction
In the realm of document management and security, incorporating watermarks into files holds paramount importance. Whether it's about branding, copyright protection, or maintaining document integrity, watermarks play a crucial role. Fortunately, GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET provides a robust solution for adding, removing, and searching watermarks in various document formats.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the implementation of watermarks using GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET, ensure the following prerequisites are met:
1. Install GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET: Download and install GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET library from the [download link](https://releases.groupdocs.com/Watermark/net/).
2. Access to Document: Have access to the document on which you want to add or remove watermarks.
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming language is necessary to understand and implement the provided code snippets.

## Import Namespaces
Before proceeding with adding image watermarks from a stream, import the necessary namespaces:
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Watermarks;
using System;
using System.IO;
```

## Step 1: Define Document Path and Output Directory
Firstly, define the path of the document where you want to add the watermark and specify the output directory for the processed document.
```csharp
string documentPath = Constants.WatermarkJpg;
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFileName = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
```
## Step 2: Open Watermark Stream
Open the watermark image file as a stream using the `File.OpenRead` method.
```csharp
using (Stream watermarkStream = File.OpenRead(documentPath))
{
    // Watermark processing logic will go here
}
```
## Step 3: Add Watermark to Document
Initialize a `Watermarker` object with the document path, then create an `ImageWatermark` object with the watermark stream obtained in Step 2. Add the watermark to the document using the `Add` method of the `Watermarker` object.
```csharp
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker("Your Document Path"))
{
    using (ImageWatermark watermark = new ImageWatermark(watermarkStream))
    {
        // Add watermark to the document
        watermarker.Add(watermark);
        // Save the document with watermark
        watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
    }
}
```
