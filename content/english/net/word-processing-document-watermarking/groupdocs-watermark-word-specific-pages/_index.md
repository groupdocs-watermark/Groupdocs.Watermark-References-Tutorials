## Implementation Guide

In this section, we'll break down the process of adding a text watermark to specific pages using **GroupDocs.Watermark**.

### Adding Text Watermarks to Specific Pages

#### Overview
This feature allows you to insert watermarks on selected pages without affecting others. It's perfect for highlighting draft versions or marking confidential sections in your documents.

##### Step 1: Define Your Document Path and Load Options
First, specify the document path and set up loading options:

```csharp
string documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/document.docx";
var loadOptions = new WordProcessingLoadOptions();
```

##### Step 2: Create a Text Watermark
Define your watermark's content and style. Customize the font, size, or color as needed.

```csharp
TextWatermark textWatermark = new TextWatermark("DRAFT", new Font("Arial", 42));
```

##### Step 3: Specify Pages for the Watermark
Decide which pages will carry the watermark. This allows you to tailor your document's appearance:

```csharp
textWatermark.PagesSetup = new PagesSetup
{
    Pages = new List<int> { 2, 3 } // Apply to pages 2 and 3.
};
```

##### Step 4: Add and Save Your Watermarked Document
Add the watermark to the document and save it:

```csharp
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    watermarker.Add(textWatermark);
    string outputFileName = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
    watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
}
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure the document path is correct and accessible.
- If pages aren't watermarking as expected, verify page numbers in your `PagesSetup`.
- Check for exceptions related to file permissions or invalid paths.

## Practical Applications

Here are some real-world scenarios where adding a text watermark can be beneficial:
1. **Draft Documents**: Clearly marking draft versions of documents before finalizing.
2. **Confidential Information**: Highlighting sections with sensitive information within larger reports.
3. **Internal Use**: Distinguishing between internal and external copies of strategic plans.

Integrating this feature into document management systems or content generation pipelines can automate the process, ensuring consistency across all documents.

## Performance Considerations

When using GroupDocs.Watermark in .NET applications, consider these tips for optimal performance:
- Limit memory usage by working with streams instead of loading entire files when possible.
- Handle exceptions gracefully to avoid application crashes.
- Dispose of `Watermarker` objects promptly to free resources.

Best practices include testing on smaller documents before scaling up and monitoring the applicationâ€™s resource consumption during processing.

## Conclusion

You've now learned how to add text watermarks to specific pages in Word documents using **GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET**. This feature is invaluable for marking drafts, confidential sections, or distinguishing document versions without altering the original content.

### Next Steps
