## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following:

### Required Libraries and Dependencies
- **GroupDocs.Watermark** - The primary library for watermarking documents.
- **.NET Framework or .NET Core** (version 2.0 or higher).

### Environment Setup Requirements
- A development environment like Visual Studio.
- Basic familiarity with C# programming.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET
To get started, you'll need to integrate the GroupDocs.Watermark library into your project. Here's how:

### Installation Information

**Using .NET CLI:**
```shell
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Watermark
```

**Using Package Manager:**
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Watermark
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI:**
- Search for "GroupDocs.Watermark" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition
You can start with a free trial or obtain a temporary license to explore all features. For long-term usage, consider purchasing a full license from [GroupDocs](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/).

### Basic Initialization and Setup
Once installed, initialize GroupDocs.Watermark in your project as follows:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark;
```
This sets the stage for you to start adding watermarks.

## Implementation Guide
Now that we've covered the setup, let's dive into implementing text watermarking.

### Feature 1: Text Watermark Addition

#### Overview
Adding a text watermark involves loading your document and embedding custom text. This section will guide you through this process step-by-step.

##### Step 1: Load the Document
First, specify the path to your Word document:

```csharp
string documentPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "YourDocument.docx");
```
Ensure that `documentPath` points to a valid file location.

##### Step 2: Create and Configure the Text Watermark
Create an instance of `TextWatermark`, customizing its font, size, and content:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options.WordProcessing;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Watermarks;

// Initialize text watermark with desired properties
TextWatermark watermark = new TextWatermark("Test watermark", new Font("Arial", 12));
```
This snippet demonstrates how to set the font and size of your watermark text.

##### Step 3: Add the Watermark to the Document
Use a `Watermarker` object to apply the watermark:

```csharp
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath))
{
    // Add watermark to document
    watermarker.Add(watermark);
}
```
Here, `watermarker.Add()` applies your configured watermark.

### Feature 2: Saving Document with Watermark
#### Overview
After adding the watermark, you must save the modified document. This section will explain how to achieve that efficiently.

##### Step 1: Define Output File Path
Choose a directory and filename for saving:

```csharp
string outputFileName = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
```
Ensure `outputFileName` does not overwrite existing files unintentionally.

##### Step 2: Save the Watermarked Document
Execute the save operation to store your watermarked document:

```csharp
// Save the document with watermark
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```
This ensures that all changes are preserved in a new file.

## Practical Applications
### Use Cases for Text Watermarking:
1. **Document Protection**: Mark sensitive documents as "Confidential" or "Draft."
2. **Branding**: Embed company logos or names across corporate documentation.
3. **Version Control**: Distinguish between document versions with version numbers as watermarks.
4. **Collaboration**: Clearly indicate authorship when sharing drafts among team members.

### Integration Possibilities
Integrate GroupDocs.Watermark with other systems for automated workflows, such as batch processing or cloud storage solutions like AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage.

## Performance Considerations
To optimize performance:
- Minimize file I/O operations by handling files in memory where possible.
- Manage resources efficiently to prevent memory leaks, especially when dealing with large documents.
- Follow .NET best practices for resource management and garbage collection.
