Now that we've covered setup, let's dive into replacing images within shapes in your Word documents.

### Overview of Replacing Images in Shapes

This feature allows you to programmatically find and replace images embedded as shapes within a document. It’s particularly useful for updating branding elements or visual content without manual editing.

#### Step 1: Load the Document

Begin by loading your Word document using the `Watermarker` class:

```csharp
string documentPath = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\YourDocument.docx";
var loadOptions = new WordProcessingLoadOptions();
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // Proceed with further operations within this block
}
```

#### Step 2: Access Document Content

Retrieve the content of the document to work with its shapes:

```csharp
WordProcessingContent content = watermarker.GetContent<WordProcessingContent>();
// Access specific sections and shapes here
```

#### Step 3: Iterate Through Shapes

Loop through each shape in a section, checking if it contains an image:

```csharp
foreach (WordProcessingShape shape in content.Sections[0].Shapes)
{
    if (shape.Image != null)  // Ensure the shape has an image to replace
    {
        // Proceed with replacing the image
    }
}
```

#### Step 4: Replace Images

For shapes containing images, load a new image and set it as the shape's content:

```csharp
string newImagePath = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\YourNewImage.png";
shape.Image = new WordProcessingWatermarkableImage(File.ReadAllBytes(newImagePath));
// This replaces the existing image with a new one
```

#### Step 5: Save Changes

After making changes, save your document to an output path:

```csharp
string outputFileName = Path.Combine(@"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Missing Image Files:** Ensure the paths to image files are correct and accessible.
- **Shape Indexing Issues:** Verify that your document structure matches expected sections/shapes indexing.

This feature can be applied in various scenarios, such as:

1. **Branding Updates:**

5. **Educational Materials:**
   - Update diagrams and illustrations in educational content seamlessly.
