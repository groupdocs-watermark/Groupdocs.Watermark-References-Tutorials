```

## Implementation Guide

In this section, we'll demonstrate how to add text watermarks to specific shapes within a Word document.

### Adding Text Watermarks to Word Documents

#### Overview
Text watermarking is an effective way to brand documents with custom messages or disclaimers. Let's explore adding formatted text as a watermark using GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET.

##### Step 1: Load Your Document
First, load the Word document where you wish to add the watermark:

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Contents.WordProcessing;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options.WordProcessing;

string documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\document.docx";
Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath);
```

##### Step 2: Create a Text Watermark
Define the text, its formatting, and appearance:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Watermarks;
using System.Drawing;

TextWatermark watermark = new TextWatermark("Confidential", new Font("Arial", 36))
{
    ForegroundColor = Color.Red,
    BackgroundColor = Color.Blue,
    RotateAngle = -45,
    Opacity = 0.5
};
```

##### Step 3: Add the Watermark
Add your configured watermark to the document:

```csharp
watermarker.Add(watermark);
```

##### Step 4: Save Your Document
Finally, save and close the watermarked document:

```csharp
watermarker.Save("output_directory\watermarked_document.docx");
watermarker.Dispose();
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure that your file paths are correct to avoid `FileNotFoundException`.
- Check that GroupDocs.Watermark is correctly installed in your project.

## Practical Applications
Here are some real-world scenarios where watermarking can be beneficial:
1. **Document Security**: Protect sensitive information with watermarks before sharing.
2. **Branding**: Add company logos or messages for branding purposes.
3. **Version Control**: Differentiate document versions by adding version numbers as watermarks.

## Performance Considerations
When working with large documents, consider the following:
- Optimize memory usage by disposing of objects when no longer needed.
- Use asynchronous processing to prevent UI freezing during watermarking tasks.
  Following best practices for .NET memory management will ensure your application runs efficiently.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, you learned how to implement text watermarks in Word documents using **GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET**. By following the outlined steps and utilizing GroupDocs' robust features, you can enhance document security and brand consistency with ease.
