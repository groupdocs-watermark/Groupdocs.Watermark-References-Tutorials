- A basic understanding of C# and .NET project structures will be beneficial but not necessary, as this guide will walk you through each step in detail.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET
To get started with GroupDocs.Watermark, follow these installation steps:

**.NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Watermark
```

**Package Manager:**
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Watermark
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI:**
- Search for "GroupDocs.Watermark" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition Steps:
1. **Free Trial**: Start by downloading a free trial to test out the library's capabilities.
2. **Temporary License**: For more extensive testing, you can request a temporary license.
3. **Purchase**: Once satisfied with the trial, consider purchasing a license for continued use.

After installing GroupDocs.Watermark, initialize it in your project as follows:

```

## Implementation Guide
Let's break down how to apply password protection to your Word documents step-by-step.

### Step 1: Define File Paths
First, set up the input and output file paths using placeholders. This ensures you can easily adapt this code for different directories.
```csharp
string documentPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "input.docx");
string outputFileName = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "protected_output.docx");
```

### Step 2: Load the Word Document
Next, load your document using specific load options. This step is crucial for preparing the document for protection.
```csharp
var loadOptions = new GroupDocs.Watermark.Contents.WordProcessing.WordProcessingLoadOptions();
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // We'll add more code here soon!
}
```

### Step 3: Apply Password Protection
Now, apply read-only protection to your document. This step ensures that only those with the password can make changes.
```csharp
// Retrieve content of the Word processing document
WordProcessingContent content = watermarker.GetContent<GroupDocs.Watermark.Contents.WordProcessing.WordProcessingContent>();

// Apply read-only protection with a specified password
content.Protect(WordProtectionType.ReadOnly, "7654321");
```

### Step 4: Save the Protected Document
Finally, save your protected document to the designated output path.
```csharp
// Save the protected document to the output path
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```

#### Troubleshooting Tips:
- **Common Issues**: If you encounter errors during loading or saving, verify that file paths are correct and accessible.
- **Password Complexity**: Ensure your password meets any complexity requirements set by GroupDocs.Watermark.
