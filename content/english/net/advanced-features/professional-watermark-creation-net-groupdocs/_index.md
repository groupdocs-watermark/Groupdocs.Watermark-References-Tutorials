## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have:
- Installed **.NET Core SDK** or **.NET Framework** on your system.
- Familiarity with C# programming concepts and basic file I/O operations.
- A text editor or IDE like Visual Studio for writing and testing your code.

### Required Libraries and Dependencies

You'll need to add the GroupDocs.Watermark library to your project:
- **GroupDocs.Watermark** is a powerful .NET library that allows you to apply watermarks to various document formats with ease. We’ll be using this tool to manipulate our documents in this tutorial.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET

To start, you need to install the GroupDocs.Watermark package:

### Installation Methods

**.NET CLI**

```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Watermark
```

**Package Manager Console**

```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Watermark
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI**

Search for "GroupDocs.Watermark" in the NuGet Package Manager and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition

- **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license from [GroupDocs' website](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/) for full access during your evaluation period.
- **Purchase**: For ongoing use, consider purchasing a license.

### Basic Initialization

To initialize GroupDocs.Watermark in your application:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark;

// Initialize the watermarker with document path
Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker("input.docx");
```

This setup allows you to start adding watermarks right away!

## Implementation Guide

### Adding Text Watermarks with Rotation

The feature we are focusing on demonstrates how to add a rotated text watermark. This is particularly useful for branding or securing your documents in an aesthetically pleasing way.

#### Step-by-Step Guide:

##### 1. Initialize the Watermarker Object

To begin, you need to initialize the `Watermarker` class with the path of the document you wish to modify.

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark;
using System.IO;

string documentPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "input.docx");
```

##### 2. Define Font and Text Watermark

Define the font for your watermark text and create a `TextWatermark` object with the desired properties.

```csharp
// Define font for watermark text
Font font = new Font("Calibri", 8);

// Create TextWatermark object
TextWatermark watermark = new TextWatermark("Test watermark", font);
```

##### 3. Set Alignment and Sizing

Adjust the alignment and sizing of your watermark to ensure it fits well within the document.

```csharp
// Set horizontal and vertical alignments
watermark.HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Right;
watermark.VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Top;

// Scale size relative to parent dimensions
watermark.SizingType = SizingType.ScaleToParentDimensions;
watermark.ScaleFactor = 0.5; // Adjust the scale factor as needed
```

##### 4. Apply Rotation

Add a rotation angle to give your watermark a dynamic look.

```csharp
// Set the rotation angle
watermark.RotateAngle = 45;
```

##### 5. Add and Save the Watermark

Finally, add the configured watermark to the document and save it.

```csharp
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath))
{
    // Add the watermark
    watermarker.Add(watermark);

    // Prepare output file path
    string outputDirectory = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
    string outputFileName = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, Path.GetFileName(documentPath));

    // Save changes to a new document
    watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
}
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **File Path Issues**: Ensure the paths for input and output directories are correctly set.
- **Unsupported Formats**: Verify that your document format is supported by GroupDocs.Watermark.

## Practical Applications

Text watermarking can be beneficial in various real-world scenarios:

1. **Document Security**: Prevent unauthorized copying or use of sensitive documents.
2. **Branding**: Consistently brand all company-related documents with a logo or tagline.
3. **Copyright Protection**: Clearly mark copyrighted material to deter infringement.

## Performance Considerations

When dealing with large batches of documents, consider:
- Efficient memory management by disposing of `Watermarker` objects promptly.
- Using asynchronous operations where possible to improve performance.
- Monitoring resource usage to prevent bottlenecks in processing.

## Conclusion

You've now mastered the art of adding rotated text watermarks using GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET. This technique can significantly enhance your document management process, offering both security and branding benefits. 

### Next Steps:
