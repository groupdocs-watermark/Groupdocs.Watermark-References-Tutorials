Before diving into this tutorial, let’s ensure you have everything you need to get started.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, make sure you have:

- **GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET**: This is the primary library we will be using.
- **.NET Framework** or **.NET Core/5+**: Ensure your development environment supports these frameworks.
- Basic knowledge of C# and familiarity with .NET project setups.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET

Begin by installing the GroupDocs.Watermark library in your project. You can do this using one of several methods:

**.NET CLI**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Watermark
```

**Package Manager**
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Watermark
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI**
- Search for "GroupDocs.Watermark" in the NuGet Package Manager and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition

To fully utilize GroupDocs.Watermark, consider the following options:

- **Free Trial**: Start with a free trial to explore features.
- **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license for extended testing.
- **Purchase**: For long-term use, purchase a full license directly from GroupDocs.

Once installed and licensed, initialize your environment as follows:

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Common;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Initialization code here
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Print Supported File Formats

Now, let's dive into the core functionality of retrieving and printing supported file types.

#### Overview

This feature enables you to list all the file formats that GroupDocs.Watermark can handle. It’s a great way to dynamically display support within your application.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**1. Retrieve Supported File Types**

Use the `FileType.GetSupportedFileTypes()` method to fetch all supported formats.

```csharp
IEnumerable<FileType> supportedFileTypes = FileType.GetSupportedFileTypes();
```

**2. Print Each File Type**

Iterate over each file type and print it to the console:

```csharp
foreach (FileType fileType in supportedFileTypes)
{
    Console.WriteLine(fileType);
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `FileType.GetSupportedFileTypes()`: Retrieves a collection of all file types supported by GroupDocs.Watermark.
- The loop iterates through each item, printing it to the console for easy viewing.

#### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Missing Library**: Ensure the package is correctly installed via NuGet.
- **Console Output Issues**: Verify your environment's console settings are properly configured.

## Practical Applications

Leveraging this feature can be beneficial in several real-world scenarios:

1. **File Format Support Display**: Automatically update users on supported formats within applications.
2. **Dynamic Document Processing**: Enhance document management systems by dynamically handling various file types.
3. **Integration with CMS Systems**: Seamlessly integrate into content management systems to manage diverse media files.

## Performance Considerations

To optimize the performance of your implementation:

- Use efficient data structures when handling large collections of file types.
- Manage memory effectively, especially in applications processing numerous documents.
- Follow .NET best practices for resource usage and garbage collection.
