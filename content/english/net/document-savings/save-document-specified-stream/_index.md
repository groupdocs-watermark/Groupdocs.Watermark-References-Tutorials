In this comprehensive guide, we'll walk you through everything you need to know to successfully save a document to a specified stream after watermarking it. Let's dive in and get started.
## Prerequisites
Before we jump into the tutorial, let's ensure you have everything you need to follow along seamlessly.
1. Basic Knowledge of C# Programming: Understanding the basics of C# will help you grasp the concepts more effectively.
2. GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET: Ensure you have the GroupDocs.Watermark library installed. You can download it from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/Watermark/net/).
3. Development Environment: A suitable development environment like Visual Studio.
4. Document to Watermark: Have a document ready that you want to apply the watermark to.
## Import Namespaces
To get started, you need to import the necessary namespaces into your project. These namespaces will allow you to utilize the GroupDocs.Watermark functionalities.
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Watermarks;
```
In this section, we'll break down the process into simple, digestible steps. Each step will build on the previous one, guiding you through the entire procedure.
## Step 1: Initialize the Watermarker
First, you need to initialize the `Watermarker` object with the path of the document you wish to watermark.
```csharp
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker("Your Document Path"))
{
    // Further steps will be nested within this block
}
```
## Step 2: Create a Text Watermark
Next, create a text watermark that you want to add to your document. This involves specifying the watermark text and its font properties.
```csharp
TextWatermark watermark = new TextWatermark("Test watermark", new Font("Arial", 12));
```
## Step 3: Add the Watermark to the Document
Now, you need to add the created watermark to the document using the `Add` method.
```csharp
watermarker.Add(watermark);
```
## Step 4: Save the Document to a Specified Stream
Finally, you'll save the watermarked document to a specified stream. This is where you define where and how the document should be saved.
```csharp
using (MemoryStream stream = new MemoryStream())
{
    watermarker.Save(stream);
    // The stream now contains the watermarked document
}
```
