## Introduction
In today's digital age, adding watermarks to documents has become essential for protecting intellectual property and ensuring brand integrity. Groupdocs.Watermark for .NET offers a robust solution for developers looking to embed watermarks into documents seamlessly. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the steps of saving a document with a watermark to the same file or stream using Groupdocs.Watermark for .NET.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following:
1. Development Environment: Visual Studio installed on your machine.
2. .NET Framework: Make sure you have .NET Framework 4.0 or later.
3. Groupdocs.Watermark for .NET: Download and install the latest version from the [site](https://releases.groupdocs.com/Watermark/net/).
4. License: Obtain a temporary or permanent license from [here](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/).
## Import Namespaces
To start using Groupdocs.Watermark in your .NET project, you need to import the necessary namespaces:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Watermarks;
```
## Step 1: Set Up Your Project
Before we add watermarks to our documents, we need to set up our .NET project. Here’s how:
1. Create a New Project: Open Visual Studio and create a new Console Application.
2. Add Groupdocs.Watermark Reference: Right-click on the project in Solution Explorer, choose "Manage NuGet Packages," and install the Groupdocs.Watermark package.
## Step 2: Copy the Document to a New Location
To avoid altering the original document directly, it’s a good practice to copy it to a new location first. Here’s how you do it:
```csharp
string outputFileName = Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", Path.GetFileName("Your Document Path"));
File.Copy("Your Document Path", outputFileName);
```
## Step 3: Initialize the Watermarker
Now that we have our document copied, we can initialize the Watermarker class to add our watermark:
```csharp
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(outputFileName))
{
    // watermarking goes here
}
```
## Step 4: Create and Add a Text Watermark
Next, we create a text watermark and add it to our document:
```csharp
TextWatermark watermark = new TextWatermark("Test watermark", new Font("Arial", 12));
watermarker.Add(watermark);
```
## Step 5: Save the Document
Finally, save the document with the watermark applied:
```csharp
watermarker.Save();
```

By following the steps outlined above, you can protect your documents and maintain their integrity effortlessly.
