### Basic Initialization

Here’s how to set up GroupDocs.Watermark in your .NET project:

using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options.Spreadsheet;

// Initialize Watermarker with the path to your Excel file
var documentPath = "your_spreadsheet.xlsx";
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath))
{
    // Load options can be configured as needed
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Loading and Configuring Excel Documents

Start by loading your Excel document with `SpreadsheetLoadOptions`.

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Contents.Spreadsheet;
using System.IO;

var loadOptions = new SpreadsheetLoadOptions();
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // Access the content of the spreadsheet
    var content = watermarker.GetContent<SpreadsheetContent>();
}
```

### Iterating Through Shapes

Iterate through each worksheet's shapes in reverse order to safely remove them.

```csharp
foreach (var section in content.Worksheets)
{
    for (int i = section.Shapes.Count - 1; i >= 0; i--)
    {
        // Check formatting criteria: red font color and Arial font family
        foreach (var fragment in section.Shapes[i].FormattedTextFragments)
        {
            if (fragment.ForegroundColor.Equals(Color.Red) && fragment.Font.FamilyName == "Arial")
            {
                // Remove the shape from the worksheet
                section.Shapes.RemoveAt(i);
                break; // Exit loop after removing a matching shape
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Saving the Updated Document

Save your changes to a new file once all unwanted shapes are removed.

```csharp
var outputFileName = "output_spreadsheet.xlsx";
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```

## Practical Applications

Automating shape removal in Excel can:
1. Enhance data presentation by removing unnecessary elements.
2. Streamline template management by automatically updating branding elements.
3. Improve reporting automation by eliminating non-essential graphical components.

## Performance Considerations

When working with large files, consider these tips:
- **Efficient Iteration**: Always iterate in reverse order when removing items.
- **Memory Management**: Use `using` statements to dispose of objects promptly.
- **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple files in batches for better resource management.
