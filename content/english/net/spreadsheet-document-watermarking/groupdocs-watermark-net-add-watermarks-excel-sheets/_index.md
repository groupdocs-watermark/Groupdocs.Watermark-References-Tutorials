```

## Implementation Guide
We'll tackle each feature separately for clarity and ease of understanding.

### Adding a Text Watermark to the Last Worksheet
#### Overview
This section demonstrates how to add a simple text watermark, "Test watermark", to the last worksheet in an Excel document using Arial font with size 8.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
**1. Load Your Document**
Initialize the `Watermarker` object with your document path and load options:
```csharp
string documentPath = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SpreadsheetXlsx.xlsx";
var loadOptions = new SpreadsheetLoadOptions();

using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // Code for adding watermark goes here
}
```

**2. Create and Configure the Text Watermark**
Define your text watermark using specific font settings:
```csharp
TextWatermark textWatermark = new TextWatermark("Test watermark", new Font("Arial", 8));
textWatermark.PagesSetup = new PagesSetup { LastPage = true };
watermarker.Add(textWatermark);
```
- **Parameters**: The `TextWatermark` constructor requires the watermark text and font details.
- **PagesSetup**: Configures the watermark to appear only on the last page of your spreadsheet.

**3. Save Your Document**
Once configured, save the document with the new watermark:
```csharp
watermarker.Save(@"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/SpreadsheetXlsx_Watermarked.xlsx");
```

### Adding an Image Watermark to the First Worksheet
#### Overview
This feature covers embedding a company logo or any image as a watermark on the first worksheet of your Excel file.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
**1. Load Your Document**
Similar to text watermarking, initialize with:
```csharp
string documentPath = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SpreadsheetXlsx.xlsx";
var loadOptions = new SpreadsheetLoadOptions();

using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // Image watermark code follows
}
```

**2. Create and Configure the Image Watermark**
Load your image file and set its positioning:
```csharp
using (ImageWatermark imageWatermark = new ImageWatermark(@"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/LogoJpg.jpg"))
{
    imageWatermark.PagesSetup = new PagesSetup { FirstPage = true };
    watermarker.Add(imageWatermark);
}
```
- **ImageFile**: Specify the path to your watermark image.
- **PagesSetup**: Ensures the watermark is applied only on the first worksheet.

**3. Save Your Document**
Preserve changes by saving the modified document:
```csharp
watermarker.Save(@"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/SpreadsheetXlsx_ImageWatermarked.xlsx");
```

## Practical Applications
1. **Document Security**: Use watermarks to indicate ownership and prevent unauthorized distribution.
2. **Branding**: Embed company logos on reports or invoices for brand recognition.
3. **Confidentiality Notices**: Add confidentiality notices to sensitive documents.
4. **Educational Resources**: Mark educational materials with institution names for identification.
5. **Version Control**: Differentiate document versions by adding a version number as a watermark.

## Performance Considerations
- **Optimize File Size**: Use compressed image formats like JPEG or PNG for watermarks to reduce file size and loading times.
- **Efficient Memory Management**: Dispose of objects properly using `using` statements to manage memory effectively in .NET applications.
- **Batch Processing**: For multiple files, consider batch processing techniques to enhance performance.
