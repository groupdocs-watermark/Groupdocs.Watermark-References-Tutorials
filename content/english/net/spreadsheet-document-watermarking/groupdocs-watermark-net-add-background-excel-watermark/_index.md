## Setting Up GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET

To add watermarks to Excel sheets, first install the GroupDocs.Watermark library. You can do this using different package managers:

### Installation Information

```

### License Acquisition

- Start with a **free trial** to explore its capabilities.
- For prolonged use, consider obtaining a **temporary license** or purchasing a full license from GroupDocs. Visit [this link](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/) for more details on acquiring licenses.

### Basic Initialization and Setup

Initialize your project by adding the necessary using directives:
```csharp
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options.Spreadsheet;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Watermarks;
```

## Implementation Guide

Let's break down the steps needed to add a background watermark to Excel sheets.

### Load and Prepare Your Document

First, load your Excel document with specific options:
```csharp
string documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/YOUR_INPUT_FILE.xlsx";
var loadOptions = new SpreadsheetLoadOptions();
```

**Explanation**: 
- `SpreadsheetLoadOptions` is used to handle how the spreadsheet is loaded. Adjust these settings based on your needs.

### Initialize Watermarker

Create an instance of `Watermarker`, which will manage adding watermarks:
```csharp
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // Code for watermark addition goes here.
}
```

**Explanation**: 
- This code initializes the `Watermarker` object with the path to your document and loading options.

### Create and Configure the Image Watermark

Next, create an image watermark using a logo or any desired image:
```csharp
using (ImageWatermark watermark = new ImageWatermark("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/logo.gif"))
{
    SpreadsheetBackgroundWatermarkOptions options = new SpreadsheetBackgroundWatermarkOptions();
    watermarker.Add(watermark, options);
}
```

**Explanation**: 
- `ImageWatermark` initializes the image you want to use as a watermark.
- `SpreadsheetBackgroundWatermarkOptions` is configured to ensure that your watermark appears as a background across all sheets.

### Save the Watermarked Document

After configuring and adding the watermark, save the modified document:
```csharp
string outputFileName = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY\
