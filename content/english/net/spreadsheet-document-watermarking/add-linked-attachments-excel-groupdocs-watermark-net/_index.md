## Implementation Guide

In this section, we'll guide you through implementing the feature to add linked attachments to an Excel worksheet.

### Overview of Adding Linked Attachments

This functionality allows users to embed hyperlinks within their Excel documents that lead directly to external files. This is particularly useful for linking reports, images, or supplementary data stored externally.

#### Step 1: Load the Excel Document

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Contents.Spreadsheet;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options.Spreadsheet;

// Define load options
var loadOptions = new SpreadsheetLoadOptions();

// Initialize Watermarker with your document and load options

{
    // Further steps will be implemented here
}
```

#### Step 2: Add Hyperlinks to Attachments

```csharp
var spreadsheetContent = watermarker.GetContent<SpreadsheetContent>();

foreach (var worksheet in spreadsheetContent.Worksheets)
{
    var hyperlinkCollection = worksheet.HyperlinkCollection;

    // Create a new hyperlink for the attachment
    Hyperlink link = new Hyperlink("http://example.com/attachment.pdf")
    {
        TextToDisplay = "Click here to open Attachment",
        Location = new SpreadsheetHyperlinkLocation(0, 1) // Position in the worksheet
    };

    // Add the hyperlink to the collection
    hyperlinkCollection.Add(link);
}

// Save changes
watermarker.Save("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\UpdatedSpreadsheet.xlsx");
```
