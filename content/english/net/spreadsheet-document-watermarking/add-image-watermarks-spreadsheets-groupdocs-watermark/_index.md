## Implementation Guide

### Adding Watermarks to Spreadsheet Headers or Footers

**Overview:**
This feature allows you to add image watermarks to the headers or footers of your spreadsheet documents, enhancing security and branding.

#### Step 1: Load Your Document
Firstly, specify the path for your document and configure load options:
```csharp
string documentPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "InSpreadsheetXlsx");
var loadOptions = new SpreadsheetLoadOptions();
```

#### Step 2: Initialize Watermarker and Configure Image Watermark
Next, create an instance of `Watermarker` and set up your image watermark properties:
```csharp
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    using (ImageWatermark watermark = new ImageWatermark("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/LogoPng"))
    {
        // Configure alignment and sizing
        watermark.VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Top;
        watermark.HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Center;
        watermark.SizingType = SizingType.ScaleToParentDimensions;
        watermark.ScaleFactor = 1;

        // Specify target worksheet and section (header/footer)
        SpreadsheetWatermarkHeaderFooterOptions options = new SpreadsheetWatermarkHeaderFooterOptions();
        options.WorksheetIndex = 0; // First worksheet

        watermarker.Add(watermark, options);
    }

    // Save the modified document
    string outputFileName = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
    watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **VerticalAlignment** and **HorizontalAlignment**: These properties ensure your watermark is centered horizontally and aligned to the top vertically.
- **SizingType & ScaleFactor**: Adjust these settings to fit the watermark within parent dimensions.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
If you encounter issues, check:
- File paths are correct.
- Required permissions for file access.
- Watermark image format compatibility (PNG preferred).

### Configuring Image Watermark Properties

**Overview:**
Customize your watermark further by adjusting its properties to fit your specific needs.
```csharp
ImageWatermark watermark = new ImageWatermark("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/LogoPng");
watermark.VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Top;
watermark.HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Center;
watermark.SizingType = SizingType.ScaleToParentDimensions;
watermark.ScaleFactor = 1;
```

**Key Properties:**
- **VerticalAlignment**: Aligns the watermark vertically.
- **HorizontalAlignment**: Centers it horizontally.
- **SizingType & ScaleFactor**: Adjust size relative to the parent document.
