#### Basic Initialization and Setup

Once installed, initialize the `Watermarker` class by providing your document path:

```csharp
string documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\InSpreadsheetXlsx.xlsx";
var loadOptions = new SpreadsheetLoadOptions();
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // Further processing...
}
```

This snippet sets the stage for accessing and manipulating your Excel documents.

## Implementation Guide

### Extracting Worksheet Background Information

This feature focuses on retrieving background details of each worksheet in an Excel document. Let’s break it down step-by-step:

#### Step 1: Load Your Document

Start by creating a `Watermarker` instance to handle the document loading process:

```csharp
string documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\InSpreadsheetXlsx.xlsx";
var loadOptions = new SpreadsheetLoadOptions();
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // Continue with processing...
}
```

#### Step 2: Access Worksheet Content

Retrieve the content of the spreadsheet to loop through its worksheets:

```csharp
SpreadsheetContent content = watermarker.GetContent<SpreadsheetContent>();
foreach (SpreadsheetWorksheet worksheet in content.Worksheets)
{
    if (worksheet.BackgroundImage != null)
    {
        // Process background image...
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Extract Background Information

For each worksheet, check for a background image and extract its details:

```csharp
if (worksheet.BackgroundImage != null)
{
    int width = worksheet.BackgroundImage.Width;
    int height = worksheet.BackgroundImage.Height;
    int imageSizeBytes = worksheet.BackgroundImage.GetBytes().Length;

    Console.WriteLine($"Worksheet '{worksheet.Name}' has a background image of size {width}x{height}, which is {imageSizeBytes} bytes.");
}
```

In this snippet, we extract the dimensions and size in bytes of each background image.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Missing Backgrounds**: Ensure your Excel files contain images set as backgrounds.
- **Error Handling**: Wrap your code with try-catch blocks to handle potential exceptions gracefully.

## Practical Applications

Extracting worksheet background information can be valuable in several real-world scenarios:

1. **Data Compliance Audits**: Verify that all company documents adhere to branding guidelines by checking background consistency.
2. **Document Management Systems**: Automate the categorization of documents based on visual elements for easier retrieval.
3. **Custom Reporting Tools**: Integrate extracted data into custom reports to provide insights on document aesthetics and compliance.

## Performance Considerations

Optimizing performance when working with large Excel files is crucial:

- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple worksheets in batches to manage memory usage efficiently.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Use asynchronous methods where applicable to improve responsiveness.
- **Memory Management**: Dispose of `Watermarker` instances promptly to free up resources.
