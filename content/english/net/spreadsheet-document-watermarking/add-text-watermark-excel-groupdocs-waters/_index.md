### Environment Setup Requirements:
- A development environment with .NET SDK installed (preferably .NET Core 3.1 or later).

### Knowledge Prerequisites:
- Basic understanding of C# and .NET project setup.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET

To get started, you'll need to integrate the GroupDocs.Watermark library into your .NET application. Here's how:

**Using .NET CLI:**

```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Watermark
```

**Using Package Manager:**

```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Watermark

Once installed, let's initialize and set up your project to work with watermarks.

## Implementation Guide

Now that you have everything set up, itâ€™s time to dive into adding watermarks to Excel files using GroupDocs.Watermark.

### Feature: Adding Text Watermarks

This feature allows you to embed a text watermark within an Excel workbook. Follow the steps below for implementation:

#### Step 1: Prepare Your Project

Ensure your project references GroupDocs.Watermark and includes necessary namespaces:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options.Spreadsheet;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Watermarks;
```

#### Step 2: Initialize Watermarker

Create a `Watermarker` instance by providing the path to your Excel file and load options. This step is crucial as it sets up the document for watermarking.

```csharp
string documentPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "example.xlsx");
var loadOptions = new SpreadsheetLoadOptions();
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // Further steps will be implemented here.
}
```

#### Step 3: Create and Configure the Watermark

Define a `TextWatermark` with desired text and font settings. This is where you customize the appearance of your watermark.

```csharp
TextWatermark watermark = new TextWatermark("Test watermark", new Font("Segoe UI", 19));
```

#### Step 4: Set Shape Options for Watermark

Configure shape options to control how the watermark appears within Excel:

```csharp
SpreadsheetWatermarkShapeOptions options = new SpreadsheetWatermarkShapeOptions();
options.Name = "Shape 1";
options.AlternativeText = "Test watermark";
options.IsLocked = true; // Prevents editing of the watermark in Excel.
```

#### Step 5: Add Watermark to Workbook

Add the configured watermark to your workbook and save it:

```csharp
watermarker.Add(watermark, options);
string outputFileName = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "watermarked_example.xlsx");
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips:
- Ensure the Excel file path is correct.
- Check that all necessary namespaces are included.

## Practical Applications

Adding watermarks to your Excel files can serve multiple purposes, such as:

1. **Document Security**: Protect sensitive data from unauthorized use or distribution.
2. **Branding**: Embed company logos or names for easy identification.
3. **Draft Status Indication**: Mark documents as drafts to prevent premature sharing.

Integration with other systems like document management solutions can automate watermarking across numerous files, enhancing efficiency and security.

While GroupDocs.Watermark is powerful, consider these tips to optimize performance:
- Minimize resource usage by handling only the necessary sheets.
