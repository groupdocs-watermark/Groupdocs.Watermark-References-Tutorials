## Implementation Guide

### Extracting Headers and Footers Information

This feature allows you to extract detailed information about headers and footers from each worksheet in an Excel document.

#### Initializing GroupDocs.Watermark

Begin by setting up the necessary paths and loading options:

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Contents.Spreadsheet;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options.Spreadsheet;

string documentPath = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\your_document.xlsx";
var loadOptions = new SpreadsheetLoadOptions();
```

#### Accessing Worksheet Headers and Footers

Hereâ€™s how to extract and display header/footer details:

```csharp
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // Get the content of the spreadsheet.
    SpreadsheetContent content = watermarker.GetContent<SpreadsheetContent>();

    // Iterate over each worksheet in the document.
    foreach (SpreadsheetWorksheet worksheet in content.Worksheets)
    {
        // Access headers and footers for each worksheet.
        foreach (SpreadsheetHeaderFooter headerFooter in worksheet.HeadersFooters)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(headerFooter.HeaderFooterType);  // Print type of header/footer

            // Iterate over each section within a header/footer.
            foreach (SpreadsheetHeaderFooterSection section in headerFooter.Sections)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(section.SectionType);  // Print section type (e.g., Left, Center, Right)

                if (section.Image != null)  // Check for image presence
                {
                    Console.WriteLine($"Image Width: {section.Image.Width}, Height: {section.Image.Height}");
                    Console.WriteLine($"Image Size: {section.Image.GetBytes().Length} bytes");
                }

                Console.WriteLine(section.Script);  // Print any script associated with the section.
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Code Snippets
- **SpreadsheetLoadOptions**: Used to load the Excel document. Customize this for different loading scenarios if needed.
- **Watermarker**: The main class that handles watermark extraction. It requires a file path and load options.
- **GetContent<>()**: Retrieves content, specifically `SpreadsheetContent` here, which includes worksheet details.

## Practical Applications

Here are some real-world uses of extracting headers and footers from Excel files:
1. **Data Reporting**: Automate the generation of reports by pulling header/footer metadata for documentation purposes.
2. **Compliance Checks**: Ensure consistent formatting across multiple documents within regulated industries.
3. **Integration with Data Management Systems**: Streamline data entry processes by using extracted metadata as a verification mechanism.

## Performance Considerations

When working with large Excel files, consider the following:
