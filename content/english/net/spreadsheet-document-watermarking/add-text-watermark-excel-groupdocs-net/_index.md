### Environment Setup Requirements:
- Visual Studio (2017 or later) or any compatible IDE that supports .NET development.
- Basic knowledge of C# programming and file handling.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET
To get started, you'll need to install the GroupDocs.Watermark library. Here’s how:

### Installation via .NET CLI
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Watermark
```

### Using Package Manager Console
```plaintext
Install-Package GroupDocs.Watermark
```

### Through NuGet Package Manager UI
- Open your project in Visual Studio.
- Navigate to the "Manage NuGet Packages" option.
- Search for "GroupDocs.Watermark" and install the latest version.

#### License Acquisition
You can start with a free trial of GroupDocs.Watermark. If you need extended functionality, consider purchasing a license or applying for a temporary one from their website.

### Basic Initialization
After installation, create an instance of `Watermarker` to begin working with documents:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options.Spreadsheet;
var loadOptions = new SpreadsheetLoadOptions();
```

## Implementation Guide
Now that you have the setup ready, let's proceed with adding a text watermark to your Excel spreadsheet.

### Loading a Spreadsheet Document

#### Overview
The first step is loading your document so it can be modified.

##### Step 1: Initialize Watermarker
Create an instance of `Watermarker` using the path of your Excel file and load options.

```csharp
using System.IO;
var documentPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "spreadsheet.xlsx");
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // The spreadsheet is now loaded and ready for watermarking.
}
```

### Adding a Text Watermark to a Spreadsheet Document

#### Overview
Once the document is loaded, you can add your text watermark.

##### Step 2: Create TextWatermark
Define the content and style of your watermark using `TextWatermark`.

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Watermarks;
using System.Drawing;

var watermark = new TextWatermark("Confidential", new Font("Arial", 12));
```

**Explanation:** 
- **"Confidential"**: The text you want to display as the watermark.
- **Font settings**: Adjust the font type and size based on your preference.

##### Step 3: Add Watermark
Use the `Watermarker`'s `Add` method to insert the watermark into the document.

```csharp
watermarker.Add(watermark);
```

##### Step 4: Save Modified Document
After adding the watermark, save the modified spreadsheet with a new filename.

```csharp
var outputFileName = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "watermarked_spreadsheet.xlsx");
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```

## Practical Applications
1. **Branding**: Add your company logo or name to all shared Excel files for brand consistency.
2. **Security**: Mark documents as "Confidential" before sharing with external partners.
3. **Document Tracking**: Include a watermark that contains version information or the creation date.

These use cases demonstrate how GroupDocs.Watermark can be integrated into document management workflows, enhancing both security and branding efforts.

## Performance Considerations
When dealing with large spreadsheets, consider these performance tips:
- Optimize font size and complexity to reduce processing time.
- Save documents incrementally if working with extremely large datasets.
- Use efficient memory management practices in .NET to handle resources effectively.
