### License Acquisition
To fully utilize GroupDocs.Watermark, start with a free trial or request a temporary license. For long-term use, consider purchasing a full license. Visit [GroupDocs’ purchase page](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/) for more details.

### Basic Initialization and Setup
Once installed, initialize the library in your project as follows:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark;
// Initialize Watermarker with an Excel document path
string documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/spreadsheet.xlsx";
var loadOptions = new SpreadsheetLoadOptions();
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // Your code goes here...
}
```

## Implementation Guide
Now that you have GroupDocs.Watermark set up, let's delve into modifying shape properties in an Excel worksheet.

### Accessing and Modifying Shape Properties (H2)
This feature allows you to programmatically locate and adjust specific shapes within your spreadsheet. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

#### Load Your Spreadsheet
Begin by loading your Excel document using `Watermarker` with appropriate load options.

```csharp
string documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/spreadsheet.xlsx";
var loadOptions = new SpreadsheetLoadOptions();
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // Proceed to access the content...
}
```

#### Retrieve and Iterate Through Shapes
Access shapes within your worksheet using `SpreadsheetContent`.

```csharp
// Get content of the document as SpreadsheetContent object.
SpreadsheetContent content = watermarker.GetContent<SpreadsheetContent>();

foreach (SpreadsheetShape shape in content.Worksheets[0].Shapes)
{
    // Check if specific text exists and modify properties accordingly...
}
```

#### Modify Shape Properties
For shapes containing specific text, adjust their attributes.

```csharp
if (shape.Text == "© Aspose 2019")
{
    // Set alternative text for the shape.
    shape.AlternativeText = "watermark";

    // Adjust rotation angle of the shape.
    shape.RotateAngle = 30;

    // Change position and dimensions of the shape.
    shape.X = 200;
    shape.Y = 200;
    shape.Width = 400;
    shape.Height = 100;
}
```

### Save Your Changes
Once modifications are complete, save the changes to a new file.

```csharp
string outputFileName = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```

## Practical Applications (H2)
This feature is versatile and can be applied in various scenarios:
1. **Watermark Adjustments:** Quickly modify watermarks for branding or copyright purposes.
2. **Dynamic Report Generation:** Automatically adjust shapes within automated reports to enhance clarity.
3. **Template Customization:** Customize templates by programmatically altering shape properties.

## Performance Considerations (H2)
To ensure optimal performance when using GroupDocs.Watermark:
- **Resource Management:** Properly manage resources by disposing of `Watermarker` instances once processing is complete.
- **Efficient Iteration:** Limit the number of shapes processed in each loop to avoid unnecessary overhead.
- **Memory Usage:** Be mindful of memory usage, especially with large documents.
