## Implementation Guide

### Replacing Text in Word Shapes

This feature allows you to modify text within any shape found in a Word document. Here’s how you can achieve this:

**1. Load Your Document**
Begin by loading the Word document where you'll replace the text.
```csharp
// Define paths for input and output documents
string documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/InDocumentDocx.docx";
string outputFileName = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "OutputDocx.docx");

using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath))
{
    // Proceed to the next step: find shapes with text
}
```

**2. Find and Replace Text in Shapes**
Identify all shapes that contain text, iterate over them, and replace the desired content.
```csharp
// Access Word document's shapes
var wordShapes = watermarker.GetContent<WordProcessingShape>();

foreach (var shape in wordShapes)
{
    if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(shape.Text))
    {
        // Define your replacement logic here
        shape.Text = "New Formatted Text";
        
        // Explanation: We're replacing the existing text with new content within each shape.
    }
}

// Save changes to a new document
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```
