## Implementation Guide

### Overview: Search Images in PDF Documents

This feature lets you find all images embedded within a PDF document, crucial for applications like digital asset management or content analysis.

#### Step 1: Define Paths and Initialize Watermarker
```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Contents.Image;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options.Pdf;

string inputFilePath = @"YOUR_INPUT_PDF_PATH";
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(inputFilePath))
{
    // We will now search for images in the document...
}
```
*Explanation*: Here, we initialize `Watermarker` with our PDF file. This class is fundamental to accessing and manipulating watermark-related features.

#### Step 2: Search for Images
```csharp
ImageSearchCriteria criteria = new ImageSearchCriteria();
// Retrieve all image objects from the PDF
PossibleWatermarkCollection images = watermarker.Search(criteria);

foreach (ImageWatermark image in images)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Found an image with size {image.Width}x{image.Height}");
}
```
*Explanation*: We use `ImageSearchCriteria` to locate and iterate through each image found within the document.

#### Key Configuration Options
- **File Path**: Ensure you specify correct paths for input and output.
- **Output Format**: Customize how you wish to handle found images (e.g., save, analyze).

### Troubleshooting Tips
- If `PossibleWatermarkCollection` is empty, ensure your PDF contains embedded images.
- Verify the file path correctness to avoid I/O errors.

## Practical Applications

1. **Digital Archiving**: Store and catalog images for historical records.
2. **Content Analysis**: Automate content review by extracting visual data from documents.
3. **Asset Management**: Maintain a database of all images used in corporate PDFs.

Integration with other systems like databases or document management platforms can enhance these use cases, enabling automated workflows.

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizing Performance
- **Memory Management**: Dispose of `Watermarker` objects promptly to free memory.
- **Batch Processing**: If processing multiple documents, consider parallel execution where possible.

### Best Practices for .NET Memory Management with GroupDocs.Watermark
- Use `using` statements to ensure proper disposal of resources.
- Monitor application performance and optimize based on specific use cases.
