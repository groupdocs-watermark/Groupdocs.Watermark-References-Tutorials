using GroupDocs.Watermark.Contents.Spreadsheet;

// Initialize Watermarker with the path to an Excel file
Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\example.xlsx");
```

## Implementation Guide

### Replace Hyperlinks in Charts and Shapes

#### Overview
This feature allows you to search for hyperlinks associated with charts and shapes within your Excel spreadsheets and replace them as needed. Whether it’s updating outdated links or standardizing URLs across documents, this functionality ensures consistency.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

##### 1. Set Up the Document Path
Begin by defining the paths to your document directory:

```csharp
string documentPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "example.xlsx");
```

##### 2. Load the Spreadsheet
Load the Excel spreadsheet into GroupDocs.Watermark.

```csharp
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath))
{
    // Add your hyperlink replacement logic here
}
```

##### 3. Search for Hyperlinks in Charts and Shapes
Use specific classes to locate hyperlinks within charts and shapes.

```csharp
// Access chart-specific content
ChartContent[] charts = watermarker.GetContent<SpreadsheetContent>().Charts;

foreach (var chart in charts)
{
    foreach (Hyperlink hyperlink in chart.Hyperlinks)
    {
        // Logic to replace the hyperlink
    }
}

// Similarly, you can access shapes and their hyperlinks
```

##### 4. Replace Hyperlinks
Replace existing hyperlinks with new URLs.

```csharp
foreach (var hyperlink in chart.Hyperlinks)
{
    hyperlink.Url = "http://newurl.com";
}
```

##### Explanation of Parameters
- `SpreadsheetContent` class provides access to all content within the spreadsheet.
- `Hyperlink` objects represent individual hyperlinks that can be updated or replaced.

#### Key Configuration Options
Adjust configurations based on your document's specific needs, such as setting up search patterns for hyperlink text.

## Practical Applications

1. **Automated Report Updating**: Regularly update links in financial reports to ensure stakeholders have the most current data.
2. **Data Standardization**: Standardize URLs across multiple spreadsheets for consistent branding and navigation.
3. **Integration with Document Management Systems**: Use GroupDocs.Watermark alongside other libraries like Aspose.Cells for comprehensive document management solutions.

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizing Performance
- Minimize memory usage by processing large documents in chunks if possible.
- Optimize your code to reduce unnecessary iterations over spreadsheet content.

### Best Practices for .NET Memory Management
Ensure that objects are disposed of properly using `using` statements to prevent memory leaks. Regularly profile your application to monitor resource utilization.
