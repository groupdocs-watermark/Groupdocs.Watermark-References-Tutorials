- **Development Environment**: A working environment with .NET Framework or .NET Core installed is necessary.

### Environment Setup Requirements
- Access to a .NET-supported IDE, such as Visual Studio.
- Knowledge of C# programming for understanding and implementing code snippets provided.

### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of licensing concepts in software development.
- Familiarity with .NET application development will be beneficial.

With these prerequisites in place, you're ready to set up GroupDocs Watermark for your project.

## Setting Up GroupDocs Watermark for .NET

To start using GroupDocs Watermark, follow the installation instructions below:

**.NET CLI**
```shell
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Watermark
```

**Package Manager Console**
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Watermark
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI**
- Open your project in Visual Studio.
- Search for "GroupDocs Watermark" in the NuGet Package Manager and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition Steps

1. **Free Trial**: Download a free trial license from GroupDocs to explore their watermarking features fully.
2. **Temporary License**: Apply for a temporary license for extended access during development if needed.
3. **Purchase**: For ongoing use in production environments, consider purchasing a commercial license.

### Basic Initialization and Setup

Once installed, initialize your application by including the necessary namespaces:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark;
```

Next, set up your basic environment to start working with watermarks.

## Implementation Guide

Now that you've set up your project, let's dive into implementing a metered license feature. We'll break it down step-by-step for clarity.

### Setting Metered License

This feature allows you to control and monitor the usage of GroupDocs Watermark by setting a metered key.

#### Overview

The `SetMeteredLicense` method integrates your application with GroupDocs' licensing server, enabling you to track usage based on the keys provided. This is crucial for ensuring compliance in enterprise environments or when distributing software with usage restrictions.

##### Step 1: Define Your License Keys
Start by defining your public and private license keys. These are unique to your account and application:

```csharp
string publicKey = "*****"; 
string privateKey = "*****";
```

##### Step 2: Create an Instance of the Metered Class
Initialize the `Metered` class, which handles interactions with GroupDocs' licensing server:

```csharp
Metered metered = new Metered();
```

##### Step 3: Set the Metered Key
Use your license keys to set up the metered configuration. This step links your application's usage to the keys provided by GroupDocs.

```csharp
metered.SetMeteredKey(publicKey, privateKey);
```

**Explanation**: The `SetMeteredKey` method configures your application to track its watermarking activities according to the specified license limits.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Invalid Keys**: Ensure that your public and private keys are correctly copied from GroupDocs.
- **Network Issues**: Verify network connectivity if you encounter errors related to server communication.
- **Version Compatibility**: Check that your version of GroupDocs Watermark is compatible with the .NET framework in use.

## Practical Applications
Understanding how metered licensing can be applied in real-world scenarios will help you leverage its full potential:
1. **Enterprise Document Management**: Control usage across multiple departments or users within an organization.
2. **Software Distribution**: Set limits on how many times your software can apply watermarks before requiring renewal.
3. **Trial Version Restrictions**: Offer trial versions with limited functionality to encourage upgrades.

## Performance Considerations
To ensure optimal performance while using GroupDocs Watermark, consider the following:
- **Resource Usage Guidelines**: Monitor memory and CPU usage when processing large batches of documents.
- **Best Practices for .NET Memory Management**:
  - Dispose of objects properly after use to free up resources.
  - Use asynchronous methods where possible to improve responsiveness.
