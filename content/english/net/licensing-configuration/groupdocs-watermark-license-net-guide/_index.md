## Implementation Guide

### Setting License from File

**Overview:**
Setting the license is crucial for unlocking all features of GroupDocs.Watermark without limitations.

#### Step 1: Define Your Constants
Start by defining constants for paths to make path handling more manageable:

```csharp
public static class Constants
{
    public const string LicenseFilePath = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\GroupDocs.License.lic";
}
```

#### Step 2: Apply the License
Here’s how you can apply the license using a file:

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Watermark;

namespace WatermarkSetup
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main()
        {
            // Load and set the license.
            var license = new License();
            try
            {
                license.SetLicense(Constants.LicenseFilePath);
                Console.WriteLine("License applied successfully.");
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Error setting license: {ex.Message}");
            }
        }
    }
}
```
