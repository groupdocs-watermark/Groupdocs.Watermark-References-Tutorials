# Add Watermark to Section Images in Word Docs

## Introduction
In today's digital world, protecting your documents is essential. Adding watermarks to your Word documents is a simple yet effective way to secure your content. This tutorial will guide you through the process of adding watermarks to section images in Word documents using Groupdocs.Watermark for .NET. Whether you're a developer looking to integrate this feature into your application or simply want to protect your documents, this guide is for you.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the details, ensure you have the following:
1. Groupdocs.Watermark for .NET: Download it [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/Watermark/net/).
2. .NET Framework: Make sure you have .NET Framework installed on your machine.
3. A Word Document: Have a Word document ready that you want to add watermarks to.
4. Development Environment: Visual Studio or any other .NET compatible IDE.
5. Temporary License: Obtain a [temporary license](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/) for Groupdocs.Watermark.
## Import Namespaces
To get started, import the necessary namespaces into your project. This is a crucial step to ensure that all functionalities of Groupdocs.Watermark are available.
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Common;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Contents.Image;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Contents.WordProcessing;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options.WordProcessing;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Watermarks;
using System.IO;
using System;
```
Now, let's break down the process into manageable steps.
## Step 1: Setting Up Your Project
First, set up your project in your preferred IDE. Create a new .NET project and install the Groupdocs.Watermark library.
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Watermark
```
## Step 2: Load the Word Document
Load the Word document that you want to watermark. Ensure the path to your document is correct.
```csharp
string documentPath = "Your Document Path";
string outputFileName = Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
var loadOptions = new WordProcessingLoadOptions();
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // Your code will go here
}
```
## Step 3: Create the Watermark
Create a text watermark that you will apply to the images in the Word document. Customize the text, font, size, and alignment to suit your needs.
```csharp
TextWatermark watermark = new TextWatermark("Protected image", new Font("Arial", 8));
watermark.HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Center;
watermark.VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Center;
watermark.RotateAngle = 45;
watermark.SizingType = SizingType.ScaleToParentDimensions;
watermark.ScaleFactor = 1;
```
## Step 4: Retrieve Images from the First Section
Access the content of the Word document and find all images in the first section. This step is crucial as it identifies the images to which the watermark will be applied.
```csharp
WordProcessingContent content = watermarker.GetContent<WordProcessingContent>();
WatermarkableImageCollection images = content.Sections[0].FindImages();
```
## Step 5: Apply Watermark to Images
Loop through each image in the first section and apply the created watermark. This ensures that all images in the section are protected.
```csharp
foreach (WatermarkableImage image in images)
{
    image.Add(watermark);
}
```
## Step 6: Save the Document
Finally, save the watermarked document to the specified path. This completes the process of adding a watermark to section images in a Word document.
```csharp
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```
## Conclusion
Adding watermarks to images within your Word documents is a powerful way to protect your content. With Groupdocs.Watermark for .NET, this process is straightforward and efficient. Follow the steps outlined in this tutorial to ensure your documents are secure and well-protected.
