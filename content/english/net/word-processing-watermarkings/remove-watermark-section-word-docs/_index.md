In the digital age, protecting the integrity of documents is paramount, especially when it comes to sensitive information or proprietary content. Watermarking is a commonly used technique to assert ownership, brand identity, or simply indicate the status of a document. However, there are instances where removing watermarks becomes necessary, either due to editing requirements or privacy concerns.

```
## Step 3: Search for Watermarks
```csharp
    // Call Search method for the section
    WordProcessingContent content = watermarker.GetContent<WordProcessingContent>();
    PossibleWatermarkCollection possibleWatermarks = content.Sections[0].Search(textSearchCriteria.Or(imageSearchCriteria));
```
## Step 4: Remove Watermarks
```csharp
    // Remove all found watermarks
    for (int i = possibleWatermarks.Count - 1; i >= 0; i--)
    {
        possibleWatermarks.RemoveAt(i);
