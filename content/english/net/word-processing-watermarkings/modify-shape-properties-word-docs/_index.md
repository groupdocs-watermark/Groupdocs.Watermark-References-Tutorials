## Step 3: Modify Shape Properties
Iterate through the shapes in the document's sections and apply the desired modifications:
```csharp
foreach (WordProcessingShape shape in content.Sections[0].Shapes)
{
    if (shape.Text.Contains("Some text"))
    {
        shape.AlternativeText = "watermark";
        shape.RotateAngle = 30;
        shape.X = 200;
        shape.Y = 200;
        shape.Height = 100;
        shape.Width = 400;
        shape.BehindText = false;
    }
}
```
## Step 4: Save the Document
Once the modifications are applied, save the document with the changes:
