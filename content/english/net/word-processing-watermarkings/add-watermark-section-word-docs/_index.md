# Add Watermark to Section in Word Docs

## Introduction
Watermarking your documents is a crucial step in protecting your content and asserting ownership. In this comprehensive tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of adding a watermark to a specific section in Word documents using GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET. Whether you're a developer or someone with a basic understanding of coding, this guide will help you secure your documents effectively.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, let's ensure you have everything you need to get started:
1. Development Environment: You should have a .NET development environment set up on your machine. Visual Studio is a popular choice.
2. GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET: Make sure you have the GroupDocs.Watermark library installed. You can download it from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/Watermark/net/).
3. Basic C# Knowledge: This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of C# programming.
## Import Namespaces
To work with GroupDocs.Watermark in your .NET project, you need to import the necessary namespaces. Here's how you do it:
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options.WordProcessing;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Watermarks;
using System.IO;
using System;
```
Now, let’s break down the process into detailed, easy-to-follow steps.
## Step 1: Set Up Your Project
Before adding a watermark, set up your project correctly. Start by creating a new .NET project in Visual Studio:
1. Open Visual Studio.
2. Create a new project and select "Console App (.NET Core)".
3. Name your project and click "Create".
## Step 2: Install GroupDocs.Watermark
Next, you need to install the GroupDocs.Watermark library. You can do this via NuGet Package Manager:
1. Right-click on your project in Solution Explorer.
2. Select "Manage NuGet Packages".
3. Search for "GroupDocs.Watermark".
4. Install the package.
## Step 3: Load Your Document
Now, it's time to load the document you want to watermark. Here’s how you do it:
```csharp
string documentPath = "Your Document Path";
var loadOptions = new WordProcessingLoadOptions();
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // Your code will go here
}
```
## Step 4: Create the Watermark
Create a text watermark that will be applied to your document. This step involves specifying the text, font, and size:
```csharp
TextWatermark watermark = new TextWatermark("Test watermark", new Font("Arial", 19));
```
## Step 5: Define Watermark Options
To add the watermark to a specific section, you need to define the watermark options:
```csharp
WordProcessingWatermarkSectionOptions options = new WordProcessingWatermarkSectionOptions();
options.SectionIndex = 0; // This adds the watermark to the first section
```
## Step 6: Add the Watermark
With the watermark and options ready, you can now add the watermark to the document:
```csharp
watermarker.Add(watermark, options);
```
## Step 7: Save the Document
Finally, save the watermarked document to your desired location:
```csharp
string outputFileName = Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```
And that's it! You've successfully added a watermark to a specific section in a Word document using GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET.
