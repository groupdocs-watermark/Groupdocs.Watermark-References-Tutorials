## Introduction
In the realm of document management and manipulation, GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET emerges as a powerful tool, offering seamless integration and robust functionalities for watermarking documents. One of the common requirements in document processing is to set different headers and footers on the first page of Word documents. This tutorial will elucidate the process of achieving this task using GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET, breaking down each step into easily understandable segments.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the implementation, ensure the following prerequisites are met:
1. Installation of GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET: Download and install GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET from the [download link](https://releases.groupdocs.com/Watermark/net/).
2. Document Preparation: Have a Word document ready that requires the setting of different headers and footers on its first page.

## Import Namespaces
To begin, import the necessary namespaces required for utilizing GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET functionalities:
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Contents.WordProcessing;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options.WordProcessing;
using System.IO;
using System;
```
## Step 1: Load the Document
```csharp
string documentPath = "Your Document Path";
string outputFileName = Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
var loadOptions = new WordProcessingLoadOptions();
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
```
In this step, we define the path to the document that needs to be processed and specify the output file name and directory. Additionally, we initialize a `Watermarker` object with the document path and load options.
## Step 2: Access Document Content
```csharp
WordProcessingContent content = watermarker.GetContent<WordProcessingContent>();
```
Here, we retrieve the content of the Word document using the `GetContent<T>()` method of the `Watermarker` object, specifying the type of content as `WordProcessingContent`.
## Step 3: Configure Page Setup
```csharp
content.Sections[0].PageSetup.DifferentFirstPageHeaderFooter = true;
content.Sections[0].PageSetup.OddAndEvenPagesHeaderFooter = true;
```
In this step, we configure the page setup options to enable different headers and footers for the first page (`DifferentFirstPageHeaderFooter`) as well as for odd and even pages (`OddAndEvenPagesHeaderFooter`).
## Step 4: Save Changes
```csharp
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```
Finally, we save the modifications made to the document by calling the `Save()` method of the `Watermarker` object, passing the output file name.

## Conclusion
GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET provides a straightforward solution for setting different headers and footers on the first page of Word documents. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, users can effortlessly manipulate document content according to their requirements.
