# Add Image Watermark to All Headers in Word Docs

## Introduction
Watermarks can be an essential part of document management, providing a way to embed information like ownership, confidentiality, or branding into documents. In this tutorial, we’ll walk through the steps to add an image watermark to all headers in Word documents using GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET. Whether you're new to programming or an experienced developer, this guide will help you achieve your watermarking goals with ease.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the code, let's make sure we have everything we need. Here’s a checklist to get you started:
1. GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET: Download the latest version from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/Watermark/net/).
2. Development Environment: Visual Studio or any other .NET compatible IDE.
3. .NET Framework: Ensure you have the .NET framework installed.
4. Sample Word Document: A Word document where you want to add the watermark.
5. Image for Watermark: An image file you want to use as a watermark.
Once you have these ready, we can start setting up our project.
## Import Namespaces
First, let's import the necessary namespaces. These namespaces contain classes and methods that will help us work with watermarks in our documents.
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Contents.WordProcessing;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options.Spreadsheet;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options.WordProcessing;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Watermarks;
using System.IO;
using System;
```
## Step 1: Setting Up Your Project
To get started, create a new console application in Visual Studio. Add tutorialss to the GroupDocs.Watermark DLL in your project. This can be done by installing the GroupDocs.Watermark NuGet package.
```bash
Install-Package GroupDocs.Watermark
```
## Step 2: Load Your Document
The first step in adding a watermark is to load the document where the watermark will be added. Here, we’ll use the `WordProcessingLoadOptions` to load a Word document.
```csharp
string documentPath = "Your Document Path";
var loadOptions = new WordProcessingLoadOptions();
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // Code to add watermark will go here
}
```
## Step 3: Create the Image Watermark
Next, we’ll create an image watermark. This involves specifying the image file that you want to use as the watermark.
```csharp
using (ImageWatermark watermark = new ImageWatermark("Your Image Path"))
{
    // Code to apply the watermark will go here
}
```
## Step 4: Add Watermark to the First Section Headers
We need to add the watermark to all headers in the first section of the Word document. For this, we use `WordProcessingWatermarkSectionOptions` and specify the section index.
```csharp
WordProcessingWatermarkSectionOptions options = new WordProcessingWatermarkSectionOptions
{
    SectionIndex = 0
};
watermarker.Add(watermark, options);
```
## Step 5: Link Headers and Footers
To ensure that the watermark appears in the headers of all sections, we link all other headers and footers to the headers and footers of the first section.
```csharp
WordProcessingContent content = watermarker.GetContent<WordProcessingContent>();
for (int i = 1; i < content.Sections.Count; i++)
{
    content.Sections[i].HeadersFooters.LinkToPrevious(true);
}
```
## Step 6: Save the Document
Finally, we save the watermarked document to a specified path. This step ensures that your changes are written to a new file, preserving the original document.
```csharp
string outputFileName = Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```
## Conclusion
And there you have it! You've successfully added an image watermark to all headers in a Word document using GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET. This powerful library makes it easy to manage and apply watermarks to various document types, ensuring your content is protected and professionally branded.
