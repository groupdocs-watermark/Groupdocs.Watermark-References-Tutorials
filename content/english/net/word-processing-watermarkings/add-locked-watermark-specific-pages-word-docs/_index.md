## Introduction
Are you looking to add a watermark to specific pages in your Word documents, but want it to be locked so that it cannot be easily removed or edited? Youâ€™re in the right place! In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of adding a locked watermark to specific pages in Word documents using GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET. This powerful library makes it easy to apply, manage, and customize watermarks on a variety of document types. Whether you're a developer or just someone who needs to secure their documents, this guide will walk you through each step in a straightforward manner.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the tutorial, let's ensure you have everything you need:
1. GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET: You can [download](https://releases.groupdocs.com/Watermark/net/) the latest version.
2. Development Environment: An IDE like Visual Studio.
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming will be helpful.
4. Document to Watermark: A Word document (.docx or .doc) that you want to add a watermark to.
## Import Namespaces
First, you need to import the necessary namespaces in your C# project. These namespaces provide access to the classes and methods required to work with GroupDocs.Watermark.
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options.WordProcessing;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Watermarks;
using System.IO;
using System;
```
Now that we've got the prerequisites covered and the necessary namespaces imported, let's break down the process step by step.
## Step 1: Load the Word Document
To begin with, you need to load the Word document you want to add a watermark to. This can be done using the `Watermarker` class along with `WordProcessingLoadOptions`.
```csharp
string documentPath = "Your Document Path";
var loadOptions = new WordProcessingLoadOptions();
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // Continue to the next steps
}
```
## Step 2: Create the Text Watermark
Next, create a text watermark. You can customize the text, font, color, and other properties according to your requirements.
```csharp
TextWatermark watermark = new TextWatermark("Watermark text", new Font("Arial", 19));
watermark.ForegroundColor = Color.Red;
```
## Step 3: Configure Watermark Options
To apply the watermark to specific pages and lock it, configure the `WordProcessingWatermarkPagesOptions`. Here, you specify the page numbers where the watermark should appear and set the locking options.
```csharp
WordProcessingWatermarkPagesOptions options = new WordProcessingWatermarkPagesOptions();
options.PageNumbers = new int[] { 1, 3 }; // Specify the pages
options.IsLocked = true; // Lock the watermark
options.LockType = WordProcessingLockType.AllowOnlyComments; // Set lock type
// To protect with a password
// options.Password = "7654321";
```
## Step 4: Add the Watermark to the Document
With your watermark and options configured, you can now add the watermark to the document.
```csharp
watermarker.Add(watermark, options);
```
## Step 5: Save the Document
Finally, save the document with the watermark applied. Choose an appropriate output path and save the file.
```csharp
string outputFileName = Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```
