With Groupdocs.Watermark for .NET, you can seamlessly insert watermarks into Word documents while ensuring they remain locked and tamper-proof. This powerful tool offers a variety of features to cater to your watermarking needs, whether for branding, confidentiality, or security purposes. In this step-by-step tutorial, we'll walk you through how to add a locked watermark to a specific section of a Word document using Groupdocs.Watermark for .NET. Letâ€™s dive in!
## Prerequisites
Before we get started, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. Groupdocs.Watermark for .NET: Ensure you have the Groupdocs.Watermark library installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/Watermark/net/).
2. .NET Framework: Make sure you have the .NET framework set up in your development environment.
3. IDE: Use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio.
4. Document: A Word document (.docx) to apply the watermark.
## Import Namespaces
To begin, you'll need to import the necessary namespaces in your project. Here's how to do it:
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options.WordProcessing;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Watermarks;
using System.IO;
using System;
```
## Step 1: Load Your Document
First, you need to load the document to which you want to add the watermark. This step involves specifying the path of your document and loading it using the `Watermarker` class.
```csharp
string documentPath = "Your Document Path";
string outputFileName = Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
var loadOptions = new WordProcessingLoadOptions();
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // Your watermarking code will go here.
}
```
## Step 2: Create the Watermark
Next, create the watermark you want to add to your document. In this example, we'll create a text watermark with specific font settings and color.
```csharp
TextWatermark watermark = new TextWatermark("Watermark text", new Font("Arial", 19));
watermark.ForegroundColor = Color.Red;
```
## Step 3: Configure Watermark Options
Now, configure the watermark options to specify the section index and lock settings. This ensures the watermark is added to the correct section and is locked.
```csharp
WordProcessingWatermarkSectionOptions options = new WordProcessingWatermarkSectionOptions();
options.SectionIndex = 0; // Add to the first section
options.IsLocked = true; // Lock the watermark
options.LockType = WordProcessingLockType.ReadOnlyWithEditableContent; // Lock type
```
## Step 4: Add the Watermark to the Document
With your watermark and options configured, it's time to add the watermark to the document using the `Add` method of the `Watermarker` class.
```csharp
watermarker.Add(watermark, options);
```
## Step 5: Save the Modified Document
Finally, save the document with the added watermark to your desired output location.
```csharp
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```
