# Unprotect Document in Word Docs

## Introduction
GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET is a powerful API that allows developers to work with watermarks in various document formats, including Word documents. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of unprotecting a Word document using GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started with .NET development, this step-by-step guide will help you accomplish the task efficiently.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET: You need to have the GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET API installed in your development environment. You can download it from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/Watermark/net/).
2. Development Environment: Ensure you have a suitable development environment set up for .NET development, including Visual Studio or any other compatible IDE.
3. Word Document: Have a Word document that you want to unprotect ready in your file system.

## Import Namespaces
Before diving into the code, you need to import the necessary namespaces to your .NET project. This allows you to access the functionalities provided by GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET seamlessly.
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Contents.WordProcessing;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options.WordProcessing;
using System.IO;
using System;
```
## Step 1: Specify Document Path
Define the path to your Word document that you want to unprotect.
```csharp
string documentPath = "Your Document Path";
```
Replace `"Your Document Path"` with the actual path to your Word document.
## Step 2: Set Output File Name
Specify the directory where you want to save the unprotected document and provide a name for the output file.
```csharp
string outputFileName = Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
```
Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the directory path where you want to save the output file.
## Step 3: Load Document with Options
Create an instance of `WordProcessingLoadOptions` to load the Word document with specific options.
```csharp
var loadOptions = new WordProcessingLoadOptions();
```
## Step 4: Unprotect the Document
Instantiate the `Watermarker` class with the document path and load options. Then, get the content of the document as WordProcessingContent and unprotect it.
```csharp
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    WordProcessingContent content = watermarker.GetContent<WordProcessingContent>();
    content.Unprotect();
    watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
}
```
