# Replace Shape Image in Word Docs

## Introduction
In the realm of software development, particularly in the .NET environment, handling document manipulation efficiently and securely is crucial. Among the myriad of tasks developers often encounter, one common challenge is replacing shape images within Word documents programmatically. This can be a tedious task without the right tools and libraries.
Fortunately, GroupDocs offers a powerful solution in the form of GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET, a versatile library designed to handle watermarking and manipulating watermarks within various document formats, including Word documents. In this tutorial, we'll delve into the step-by-step process of replacing shape images in Word documents using GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET.
## Prerequisites
Before we embark on this tutorial, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET Library: Download and install the GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET library from the [download link](https://releases.groupdocs.com/Watermark/net/).
2. Document to Manipulate: Prepare a Word document containing shape images that you intend to replace programmatically.
3. Development Environment: Have a working development environment set up, preferably Visual Studio, with .NET capabilities.
4. Basic Knowledge of C# Programming: Familiarize yourself with C# programming basics, as we'll be using C# to interact with the GroupDocs.Watermark library.
## Import Namespaces
Before we dive into the coding part, let's import the necessary namespaces to our C# project:
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Contents.WordProcessing;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options.WordProcessing;
using System;
using System.IO;
```
## Step 1: Load the Document
```csharp
string documentPath = "Your Document Path";
string outputFileName = Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
var loadOptions = new WordProcessingLoadOptions();
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // Document loaded successfully
}
```
In this step, we define the path to the Word document we want to manipulate. Then, we create an instance of `WordProcessingLoadOptions` to specify the load options for the Word document. Next, we initialize a `Watermarker` object with the document path and load options.
## Step 2: Access Document Content
```csharp
WordProcessingContent content = watermarker.GetContent<WordProcessingContent>();
```
Here, we retrieve the content of the Word document using the `GetContent` method of the `Watermarker` object. The content is stored in a `WordProcessingContent` object, which allows us to access and manipulate various elements within the document.
## Step 3: Replace Shape Images
```csharp
foreach (WordProcessingShape shape in content.Sections[0].Shapes)
{
    if (shape.Image != null)
    {
        shape.Image = new WordProcessingWatermarkableImage(File.ReadAllBytes(Constants.TestPng));
    }
}
```
In this step, we iterate through each shape in the first section of the document. For each shape that contains an image (`shape.Image != null`), we replace the existing image with a new one. In this example, we're using a constant `TestPng` as the replacement image. Ensure to replace it with the path to your desired image.
## Step 4: Save the Document
```csharp
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```
Finally, we save the modified document with the replaced images to the specified output file name.

## Conclusion
GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET simplifies the process of replacing shape images in Word documents programmatically. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can seamlessly integrate this functionality into your .NET applications, saving time and effort in document manipulation tasks.
