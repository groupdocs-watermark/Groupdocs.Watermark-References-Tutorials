## Import Namespaces
To kickstart the process of shape removal in Word documents using GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET, import the necessary namespaces into your project:
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Contents.WordProcessing;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options.WordProcessing;
using System.IO;
using System;
```
## Step 1: Load the Document
Begin by specifying the path to the Word document you wish to manipulate and create an output file name for the processed document:
```csharp
string documentPath = "Your Document Path";
string outputFileName = Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
```
## Step 2: Initialize Watermarker
Initialize a `Watermarker` object by passing the document path and optional load options:
```csharp
var loadOptions = new WordProcessingLoadOptions();
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
```
## Step 3: Access Document Content
Retrieve the content of the Word document to access its sections and shapes:
```csharp
WordProcessingContent content = watermarker.GetContent<WordProcessingContent>();
```
## Step 4: Remove Shape by Index
Remove a shape from the document by specifying its index within the `Shapes` collection:
```csharp
content.Sections[0].Shapes.RemoveAt(0);
```
## Step 5: Remove Shape by Reference
Alternatively, remove a shape by directly referencing it within the `Shapes` collection:
```csharp
content.Sections[0].Shapes.Remove(content.Sections[0].Shapes[0]);
```
## Step 6: Save the Document
Save the modified document to the specified output file:
```csharp
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
