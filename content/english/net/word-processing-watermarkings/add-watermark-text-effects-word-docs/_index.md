## Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure you have the following:

## Step 1: Load the Document
Load the Word document onto which you want to add the watermark.

var loadOptions = new WordProcessingLoadOptions();
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))

```
## Step 2: Add Watermark with Text Effects
Create a text watermark with desired text and font, then define text effects such as line format.
```csharp
TextWatermark watermark = new TextWatermark("Test watermark", new Font("Arial", 19));
WordProcessingTextEffects effects = new WordProcessingTextEffects();
effects.LineFormat.Enabled = true;
effects.LineFormat.Color = Color.Red;
effects.LineFormat.DashStyle = OfficeDashStyle.DashDotDot;
effects.LineFormat.LineStyle = OfficeLineStyle.Triple;
effects.LineFormat.Weight = 1;
```
## Step 3: Customize Watermark Options
Define watermark section options, such as text effects, and assign them to the watermark.
```csharp
WordProcessingWatermarkSectionOptions options = new WordProcessingWatermarkSectionOptions();
options.Effects = effects;
watermarker.Add(watermark, options);
```
## Step 4: Save the Document
Save the modified document with the added watermark.
```csharp
