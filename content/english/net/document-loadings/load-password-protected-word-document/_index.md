# Load Password Protected Word Document

## Introduction
In the digital age, protecting and authenticating your documents is more critical than ever. Watermarking is a powerful technique to safeguard your files, and with GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET, you can do this effortlessly. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the process of watermarking a password-protected Word document, breaking down each step to ensure you understand and can implement it easily.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the watermarking process, ensure you have the following:
1. GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET: Download the latest version from the [website](https://releases.groupdocs.com/Watermark/net/).
2. Development Environment: A development environment such as Visual Studio.
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming.
4. .NET Framework: Ensure the .NET framework is installed.
5. Password-Protected Word Document: A Word document that you will be working on.
6. Temporary License: Obtain a temporary license from [GroupDocs](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/) if required.
## Import Namespaces
Before we start coding, make sure you import the necessary namespaces. This ensures that your program recognizes the GroupDocs classes and methods you will be using.
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options.WordProcessing;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Watermarks;
using System.IO;
using System;
```
## Step 1: Define Document Path and Output Path
Start by specifying the path to your document and where you want to save the watermarked file. This will help the program locate your files easily.
```csharp
string documentPath = "Your Document Path";
string outputFileName = Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
```
## Step 2: Set Load Options with Password
Next, you need to define the load options for the Word document. This is crucial for opening a password-protected document.
```csharp
var loadOptions = new WordProcessingLoadOptions();
loadOptions.Password = "P@$w0rd";
```
## Step 3: Initialize the Watermarker
Now, create an instance of the Watermarker class. This is the core class you will use to add watermarks to your document.
```csharp
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // subsequent steps will go here
}
```
## Step 4: Create the Watermark
Inside the `using` block, create the watermark object. For this example, we’ll use a text watermark.
```csharp
TextWatermark watermark = new TextWatermark("Test watermark", new Font("Arial", 12));
```
## Step 5: Add the Watermark to the Document
Add the created watermark to the document using the `Add` method of the Watermarker class.
```csharp
watermarker.Add(watermark);
```
## Step 6: Save the Watermarked Document
Finally, save the watermarked document to the specified output path.
```csharp
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```
## Conclusion
Watermarking your documents is a vital step in protecting your content, and with GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET, it’s a breeze. By following this guide, you’ve learned how to load a password-protected Word document, add a watermark, and save the result. Whether you’re securing confidential information or adding a professional touch to your documents, watermarking is an essential tool in your digital arsenal.
