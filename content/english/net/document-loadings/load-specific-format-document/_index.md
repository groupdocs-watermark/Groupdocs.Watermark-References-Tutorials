Whether you are dealing with text documents, spreadsheets, presentations, or images, this guide will walk you through the steps to load and watermark specific format documents using Groupdocs.Watermark for .NET.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. Groupdocs.Watermark for .NET: Ensure you have installed the Groupdocs.Watermark library. You can download it [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/Watermark/net/).
2. Development Environment: A development environment like Visual Studio.
3. .NET Framework: This tutorial assumes you are using .NET Framework.
4. Document to Watermark: Have a document ready that you want to apply the watermark to.
5. Basic Knowledge of C#: Understanding of C# programming language basics.

## Import Namespaces
To get started, ensure you have the necessary namespaces imported in your project. This is crucial for accessing the functionality provided by Groupdocs.Watermark.
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options.Spreadsheet;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Watermarks;
using System.IO;
using System;
```

## Step 1: Set Up Your Project
First, you need to set up your project in your development environment. Open Visual Studio, create a new project, and install the Groupdocs.Watermark for .NET package.
```shell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Watermark
```
## Step 2: Specify the Document Path
Define the path to the document you want to watermark. This step involves setting the path for the input document and the output file where the watermarked document will be saved.
```csharp
string documentPath = "Your Document Path";
string outputFileName = Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
```
## Step 3: Configure Load Options
Create an instance of `SpreadsheetLoadOptions` (or appropriate options for your document type) to specify the document format. This is essential for loading documents correctly based on their formats.
```csharp
var loadOptions = new SpreadsheetLoadOptions();
```
## Step 4: Load the Document
Use the `Watermarker` class to load the document. This class provides various methods to manage watermarks within the document.
```csharp
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // Further actions will be performed within this using block
}
```
## Step 5: Create a Watermark
Define the watermark text and style. For this example, we will create a simple text watermark.
```csharp
TextWatermark watermark = new TextWatermark("Test watermark", new Font("Arial", 12));
```
## Step 6: Add the Watermark to the Document
Add the created watermark to the document using the `Add` method of the `Watermarker` class.
```csharp
watermarker.Add(watermark);
```
## Step 7: Save the Watermarked Document
Finally, save the watermarked document to the specified output file.
```csharp
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```
