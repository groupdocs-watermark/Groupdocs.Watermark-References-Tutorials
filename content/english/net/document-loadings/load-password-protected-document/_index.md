# Load Password Protected Document

## Introduction
Are you looking to protect your documents by adding watermarks, even if they are password protected? Groupdocs.Watermark for .NET is a powerful tool that allows you to do just that. In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of loading a password-protected document and adding a watermark to it using Groupdocs.Watermark for .NET. Let's dive in!
## Prerequisites
Before we start, make sure you have the following:
1. Visual Studio: Any version of Visual Studio installed on your machine.
2. .NET Framework: Ensure that you have .NET Framework 4.6.1 or later.
3. Groupdocs.Watermark for .NET: Download and install the Groupdocs.Watermark for .NET library from the [download link](https://releases.groupdocs.com/Watermark/net/).
## Import Namespaces
First, we need to import the necessary namespaces into our project. This ensures that we can access all the methods and properties provided by Groupdocs.Watermark for .NET.
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Watermarks;
using System;
using System.IO;
```
Now, let's break down the process into simple, easy-to-follow steps.
## Step 1: Set Up Your Project
To begin, create a new C# Console Application in Visual Studio. Once your project is set up, install the Groupdocs.Watermark for .NET library via NuGet Package Manager.
1. Open Visual Studio and create a new Console App (.NET Framework).
2. Go to `Tools` > `NuGet Package Manager` > `Manage NuGet Packages for Solution`.
3. Search for `GroupDocs.Watermark` and install the package.
## Step 2: Define Document Paths
Next, you'll need to define the path to your password-protected document and the output file path where the watermarked document will be saved.
```csharp
string documentPath = "Your Document Path";
string outputFileName = Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
```
Replace `"Your Document Path"` and `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual paths on your machine.
## Step 3: Set Load Options with Password
To open a password-protected document, you must provide the password in the load options.
```csharp
LoadOptions loadOptions = new LoadOptions();
loadOptions.Password = "P@$w0rd";
```
Replace `"P@$w0rd"` with the actual password of your document.
## Step 4: Load the Document
Now, let's load the document using the `Watermarker` class.
```csharp
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // Your code to add watermark will go here
}
```
## Step 5: Create a Watermark
We will create a text watermark that we can add to the document. You can customize the text, font, size, and other properties as needed.
```csharp
TextWatermark watermark = new TextWatermark("Test watermark", new Font("Arial", 12));
```
Feel free to change `"Test watermark"`, `"Arial"`, and `12` to your preferred text, font, and size.
## Step 6: Add the Watermark
Add the watermark to the document using the `Add` method of the `Watermarker` class.
```csharp
watermarker.Add(watermark);
```
## Step 7: Save the Watermarked Document
Finally, save the watermarked document to the specified output file path.
```csharp
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```
## Conclusion
Adding watermarks to your password-protected documents is a straightforward process with Groupdocs.Watermark for .NET. By following these simple steps, you can ensure that your documents are protected and branded as per your requirements. Whether it's for security, branding, or compliance, watermarking your documents has never been easier.
