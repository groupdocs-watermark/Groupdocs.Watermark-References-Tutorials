# How to Add a Custom Font Text Watermark Using GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET

## Introduction

Are you looking to elevate your document security or branding with custom watermarks? Then, you’re in the right place! In this comprehensive guide, I’ll walk you through each step of adding a text watermark with a custom font using **GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET**. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just dipping your toes into document processing, this step-by-step tutorial makes it simple, engaging, and practical.

## Why Use Custom Font Watermarks?

Custom font watermarks help you get creative with your branding, make your watermarks more noticeable, or match specific design aesthetics. Just like choosing the right font in a logo, selecting the right font for your watermark can significantly impact visibility and style. Now, let’s dive in and see how you can add personalized watermarks to your documents with ease!

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you’ve got everything you need:

- **.NET Environment:** Visual Studio (preferably 2019 or later)
- **GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET SDK:** Download it from the [official releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/watermark/net/)
- **A Sample Document:** An image or file where you want to embed the watermark
- **Fonts Folder:** A directory containing your custom fonts (like TTF files)
- **Basic C# Knowledge:** Familiarity with C# syntax and .NET library usage

Once you have these ready, you’re all set to create your custom font watermark!

## Import Packages

This is an essential step—without importing the proper packages, your code won't compile. Here’s what you should include at the top of your C# file:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Drawing; // For Color
using System.IO; // For Path operations
using GroupDocs.Watermark; // Core SDK namespace
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Objects; // For watermark objects
```

These namespaces give you access to all the classes and methods needed to manipulate documents and add watermarks.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Adding a Custom Font Text Watermark

Now, let’s break down the entire process into manageable, straightforward steps.

### Step 1: Initialize Your File Paths and Environment

**Why:** To tell your program where the source file, output location, and fonts are. Think of it like setting your GPS before a trip.

**How:**

- Specify the path to your sample document (`documentPath`)
- Define where to save the watermarked document (`outputFileName`)
- Provide the path to your fonts folder (`fontsFolder`)

```csharp
string documentPath = @"C:\Documents\sample-image.png"; // Your source document
string outputDirectory = @"C:\Documents\Output";       // Where to save processed file
Directory.CreateDirectory(outputDirectory);            // Create directory if not exists
string outputFileName = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "watermarked-image.png");
string fontsFolder = @"C:\Fonts";                        // Font directory
```

### Step 2: Load Your Document

**Why:** To open your document in the Watermarker tool for editing.

```csharp
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath))
{
    // Proceed to next steps inside this using block
}
```

The `using` statement ensures resources are properly released after processing.

### Step 3: Load Your Custom Font

**Why:** To tell the watermark to use a specific fancy font, like “OT Chekharda Bold Italic.”

**Note:** Ensure this font file (`.ttf`) exists in your fonts folder.

```csharp
Font customFont = new Font("OT Chekharda Bold Italic", fontsFolder, 36);
```

- **Font Name:** Must match the font’s internal name.
- **Font Size:** 36 points (adjust as needed).

### Step 4: Create Your Text Watermark

**Why:** This is the actual watermark object with your custom font.

```csharp
TextWatermark watermark = new TextWatermark("Test watermark", customFont);
```

Replace `"Test watermark"` with your preferred message or text.

### Step 5: Customize Watermark Appearance

**Why:** To make your watermark visually appealing or distinctive.

```csharp
watermark.ForegroundColor = Color.Blue;      // Set color to blue
watermark.Opacity = 0.4;                     // Semi-transparent
watermark.HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Center; // Center horizontally
watermark.VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Center;     // Center vertically
```

Feel free to tweak the color, opacity, and alignment to suit your style.

### Step 6: Embed the Watermark

**Why:** The step where the watermark is added to your document.

```csharp
watermarker.Add(watermark);
```

### Step 7: Save the Watermarked Document

**Why:** To persist your changes to disk.

```csharp
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
Console.WriteLine($"Watermark added successfully! Check it out in {outputFileName}");
```

## FAQs

**1. Can I use any font in my custom watermark?**  

Yes, as long as the font file (TTF, OTF) is accessible in your fonts directory, you can use it.

**2. How do I embed multiple watermarks?**  

Loop through each watermark creation process and add them sequentially before saving.

**3. Can I add watermarks to PDFs with this method?**  

Yes, GroupDocs.Watermark supports PDFs and many other document formats.

**4. What if the font is not recognized?**  

Make sure the font name matches exactly what's inside the font file and that the font file exists in your fonts folder.

**5. Is the watermark semi-transparent by default?**  

You can control this using the `Opacity` property—0.0 is fully transparent, 1.0 is fully opaque.
