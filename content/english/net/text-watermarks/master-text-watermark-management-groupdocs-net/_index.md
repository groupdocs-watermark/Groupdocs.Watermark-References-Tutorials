### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of C# programming and .NET framework concepts.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET

To begin using GroupDocs.Watermark, install it in your project through one of the following methods:

**.NET CLI**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Watermark
```

**Package Manager Console**
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Watermark
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI**
Search for "GroupDocs.Watermark" and install the latest version.

- **Temporary License**: Apply for a temporary license for extended access during development.
- **Purchase**: For full functionality, consider purchasing a commercial license.

After installation, initialize GroupDocs.Watermark in your project:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark;

string documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_PATH";
Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath);
```

## Implementation Guide

### Searching for Text-Based Watermarks
Searching for text-based watermarks is straightforward with **GroupDocs.Watermark**. Here are the steps:

#### Step 1: Load Your Document
Start by loading your document into a `Watermarker` object.

```csharp
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Watermark;

string documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"; // Replace with your actual path

// Initialize Watermarker with the document path
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath))
{
    // Further operations will go here
}
```

#### Step 2: Define Search Criteria
Create a `TextSearchCriteria` object to specify what text you’re looking for in watermarks.

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Search;

// Set up criteria to search for the word "test"
TextSearchCriteria searchCriteria = new TextSearchCriteria("test", false);
```

#### Step 3: Search for Watermarks
Perform the search using the defined criteria. This returns a collection of possible watermarks.

```csharp
PossibleWatermarkCollection watermarks = watermarker.Search(searchCriteria);

// Iterate through found watermarks if needed
foreach (PossibleWatermark watermark in watermarks)
{
    Console.WriteLine(watermark.Text);
}
```

### Modifying Found Watermark Properties
Once you’ve identified the watermarks, modifying their properties is intuitive.

#### Step 1: Load Your Document and Search for Watermarks
Start with similar steps to searching—load your document and define search criteria.

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark;
using System;

string outputFileName = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "output.pdf"); // Replace with desired path

// Initialize Watermarker and search for watermarks
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath))
{
    TextSearchCriteria searchCriteria = new TextSearchCriteria("test", false);
    PossibleWatermarkCollection watermarks = watermarker.Search(searchCriteria);

    // Further modifications will follow
}
```

#### Step 2: Modify Watermark Properties
Loop through the collection of found watermarks and modify their properties.

```csharp
foreach (PossibleWatermark watermark in watermarks)
{
    try
    {
        // Clear existing text fragments to avoid duplication
        watermark.FormattedTextFragments.Clear();

        // Add a new formatted text fragment with specific styling
        watermark.FormattedTextFragments.Add(
            "passed",
            new Font("Calibri", 19, FontStyle.Bold),
            Color.Red,
            Color.Aqua
        );
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Error modifying watermark: {ex.Message}");
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Save the Modified Document
After making your modifications, save the document with updated watermarks.

```csharp
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```

## Practical Applications
Here are a few scenarios where these features can be useful:

1. **Brand Consistency**: Update all documents to reflect new branding guidelines by modifying existing watermarks.
2. **Document Cleanup**: Remove outdated or incorrect watermark text from legacy files across your organization.
3. **Compliance Adjustments**: Ensure all documents meet legal requirements by adding necessary watermark text.

## Performance Considerations
When working with GroupDocs.Watermark in .NET, consider these performance tips:
- Minimize resource usage by only loading and processing necessary document sections.
- Leverage asynchronous methods where possible to improve application responsiveness.
- Follow best practices for memory management in .NET applications to prevent leaks or excessive consumption.

## Conclusion
With this guide, you’ve learned how to effectively search and modify text-based watermarks using **GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET**. These skills can significantly enhance your document management processes. Next steps might include exploring more advanced watermarking features or integrating these techniques into larger projects.
