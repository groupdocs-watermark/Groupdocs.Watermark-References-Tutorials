# How to Add a Text Watermark Using GroupDocs.Watermark .NET (Absolute Positioning)

## Introduction

In today's digital world, protecting your images from unauthorized use is crucialâ€”especially when shared online or stored in public repositories. A text watermark effectively deters misuse by branding your images with identifiable information such as logos, copyrights, or company names. GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET simplifies this process, allowing you to add watermarks with precision and ease.

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to use the **GroupDocs.Watermark .NET** library to place a text watermark at absolute coordinates on an image. You will learn:
- How to set up your environment using GroupDocs.Watermark
- Steps for creating and positioning a text watermark
- Key configuration options and troubleshooting tips

Let's dive into the prerequisites you'll need before we begin.

### Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure that you have the following:
1. **Development Environment**: A .NET development environment like Visual Studio (2017 or later).
2. **GroupDocs.Watermark Library**: Install this library via NuGet.
3. **Basic Knowledge of C#**: Familiarity with C# syntax and programming concepts is required.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET
To start working with GroupDocs.Watermark, you must first add it to your project. Here's how:

### Installation
You can install the library using any of these methods:
**.NET CLI**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Watermark
```
**Package Manager**
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Watermark
```
**NuGet Package Manager UI**
Search for "GroupDocs.Watermark" in the NuGet Package Manager and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition
- **Free Trial**: Start with a free trial to test the features.
- **Temporary License**: Request a temporary license if you need extended access without limitations.
- **Purchase**: For production use, purchase a full license from GroupDocs.

#### Basic Initialization
After installation, import the necessary namespaces in your project:
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options;
```

## Implementation Guide
Now, let's move on to implementing our watermarking solution. We'll break it down into clear steps for easy understanding.

### Adding a Text Watermark with Absolute Positioning
This feature allows you to add text at specific coordinates on an image using GroupDocs.Watermark. Follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Define Paths for Input and Output Files
Determine where your source images are stored and where the output should be saved:
```csharp
string documentPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "example.png");
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFileName = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
```
#### Step 2: Load the Image into Watermarker
Open your image file using `Watermarker`:
```csharp
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath))
{
    // Further steps will be performed inside this block.
}
```
#### Step 3: Define Font Properties for Watermark Text
Set up the font style and size for your watermark text:
```csharp
Font font = new Font("Times New Roman", 8);
```
#### Step 4: Create a TextWatermark Object
Initialize the `TextWatermark` with your desired text and font properties:
```csharp
TextWatermark watermark = new TextWatermark("Test watermark", font);
```
#### Step 5: Set Absolute Position for Watermark
Specify the X and Y coordinates to position your watermark precisely on the image:
```csharp
watermark.X = 10; // X-coordinate
watermark.Y = 20; // Y-coordinate
```
#### Step 6: Define Dimensions of the Watermark
Adjust the size of your watermark:
```csharp
watermark.Width = 100;
watermark.Height = 40;
```
#### Step 7: Add the Watermark to the Image
Use `Watermarker`'s `Add()` method to place the watermark on the image:
```csharp
watermarker.Add(watermark);
```
#### Step 8: Save the Output with the Added Watermark
Finally, save your watermarked image to a file:
```csharp
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```
### Troubleshooting Tips
- **File Not Found**: Ensure the paths for input and output directories are correct.
- **Font Issues**: Check if the specified font is installed on your system.
- **Performance**: For large batches of images, consider processing them asynchronously.

## Practical Applications
Here are some real-world scenarios where you might use this feature:
1. **Branding Images**: Add company logos to marketing materials or product photos.
2. **Copyright Protection**: Protect artwork or sensitive documents with copyright watermarks.
3. **Document Verification**: Ensure authenticity in legal and official documents by embedding unique identifiers.

## Performance Considerations
To optimize performance when using GroupDocs.Watermark:
- **Batch Processing**: Process images in batches to manage memory usage effectively.
- **Resource Management**: Always dispose of `Watermarker` instances promptly after use to free up resources.
- **Optimize Image Size**: Work with appropriately sized images to reduce processing time.

## Conclusion
You've learned how to add a text watermark at absolute positions using GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET. This skill is invaluable in protecting and branding your digital assets. Next, you might explore other features of the library or integrate it into larger projects.
