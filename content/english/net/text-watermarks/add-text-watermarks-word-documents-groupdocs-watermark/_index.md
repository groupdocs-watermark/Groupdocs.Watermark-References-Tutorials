## Implementation Guide

### Adding a Text Watermark to an Entire Word Document

This feature helps you protect or brand every page of a document by adding a text watermark throughout.

#### Overview
You will create and apply a text watermark across all pages of your Word document using the GroupDocs.Watermark library.

##### Step 1: Set Up Paths for Input and Output Files
```csharp
string documentPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "YourInputDocument.docx");
string outputFileName = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "WatermarkedOutput.docx");
```

##### Step 2: Initialize Watermarker with Load Options
```csharp
var loadOptions = new WordProcessingLoadOptions();
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // Code continues...
}
```
The `WordProcessingLoadOptions` ensures that the document is loaded correctly for processing.

##### Step 3: Create and Configure the Text Watermark
```csharp
TextWatermark textWatermark = new TextWatermark("Your Watermark Text", new Font("Arial", 42));
```
The `TextWatermark` class allows you to set your desired watermark text and customize its appearance (e.g., font, size).

##### Step 4: Add the Watermark to the Document
```csharp
watermarker.Add(textWatermark);
```
This step applies the watermark across all pages.

##### Step 5: Save the Document
```csharp
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```

### Adding a Text Watermark to Specific Pages in a Word Document

Sometimes, you might want to apply watermarks only on specific pages of your document. Here’s how:

#### Overview
We'll add a watermark to particular pages, such as marking the last page with "DRAFT".

##### Step 1: Set Up Paths for Input and Output Files
```csharp
string documentPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "YourInputDocument.docx");
string outputFileName = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "WatermarkedPageOutput.docx");
```

##### Step 2: Initialize Watermarker with Load Options
```csharp
var loadOptions = new WordProcessingLoadOptions();
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // Code continues...
}
```

##### Step 3: Create and Configure the Text Watermark for Specific Pages
```csharp
TextWatermark textWatermark = new TextWatermark("DRAFT", new Font("Arial", 42));
WordProcessingContent content = watermarker.GetContent<WordProcessingContent>();
WordProcessingWatermarkPagesOptions options = new WordProcessingWatermarkPagesOptions();
options.PageNumbers = new int[] {content.PageCount};
```

##### Step 4: Add the Watermark to Specific Pages
```csharp
watermarker.Add(textWatermark, options);
```
This code snippet specifies which pages should contain the watermark.

##### Step 5: Save the Document
```csharp
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```

## Practical Applications

Here are some real-world scenarios where adding watermarks can be beneficial:
1. **Document Security**: Mark confidential documents to prevent unauthorized sharing.
2. **Branding**: Embed your company logo or name on official reports and publications.
3. **Version Control**: Use "DRAFT" or "FINAL" labels to distinguish document versions.

## Performance Considerations

When working with GroupDocs.Watermark, consider these performance tips:
- Optimize memory usage by disposing of objects promptly after use (`using` statements).
- Avoid processing large documents in a single thread if possible; consider breaking tasks into smaller chunks.
- Regularly update your library to benefit from the latest optimizations and bug fixes.
