## Implementation Guide
In this section, we'll walk through adding a text watermark to a Word document using GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET.

### Adding Text Watermarks to Word Documents
**Overview**
Adding a text watermark involves specifying the text, style, and position within the document. This feature is useful for branding or marking documents as confidential.

#### Step 1: Define Document Path and Output File Name
Start by defining the paths for your input and output files:

```csharp
string documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\YourDocument.docx";
string outputFileName = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "WatermarkedDocument.docx");
```

#### Step 2: Load the Word Document
Use the `Watermarker` class to load your document:

```csharp
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath))
{
    // Further steps will be added here.
}
```

#### Step 3: Create and Configure the Text Watermark
Create a text watermark with specific settings:

```csharp
TextWatermark watermark = new TextWatermark("Confidential", new Font("Arial", 36))
{
    RotateAngle = -45,
    Opacity = 0.5,
    ForegroundColor = Color.Red,
    HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Center,
    VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Center
};
```

#### Step 4: Add the Watermark to the Document
Add the configured watermark to your document:

```csharp
watermarker.Add(watermark);
```

#### Step 5: Save the Watermarked Document
Save the changes to a new file:

```csharp
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure all paths are correctly defined and accessible.
- Check for any missing dependencies or incorrect library versions.

## Practical Applications
Here are some real-world use cases where text watermarks can be beneficial:
1. **Confidentiality**: Marking sensitive documents as "Confidential" to prevent unauthorized sharing.
2. **Branding**: Adding your company logo or name to all outgoing documents.
3. **Drafts**: Indicating that a document is a draft version.
