```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Watermark
```

**Package Manager:**
```powershell

```

**NuGet Package Manager UI:**

### License Acquisition

To use GroupDocs.Watermark, you can start with a free trial. You can also obtain a temporary license or purchase a full license based on your needs. Check out [this page](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/) for more details on obtaining a temporary license.

### Basic Initialization and Setup

Once installed, initialize the GroupDocs.Watermark library in your project as follows:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options;

// Initialize Watermarker with the path to your Word document
Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker("path/to/your/document.docx");
```

## Implementation Guide

Now, let’s break down how you can add text watermarks to images in Word documents using GroupDocs.Watermark.

### Step 1: Load Your Document

First, load the Word document into which you want to insert a watermark. This is done by initializing the `Watermarker` class with your document path.

```csharp
// Initialize Watermarker
Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\document.docx");
```

### Step 2: Define Your Text Watermark

Next, define the text watermark you want to apply. You can customize font size, color, rotation angle, and position.

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Contents.WordProcessing;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options.WordProcessing;

TextWatermark watermark = new TextWatermark("Confidential", new Font("Arial", 36))
{
    ForegroundColor = Color.Red,
    BackgroundColor = Color.Blue,
    RotateAngle = -45,
    Opacity = 0.5
};
```

### Step 3: Apply Watermark to Images

To add the watermark specifically to images within your Word document, you’ll need to iterate over image content and apply the watermark.

```csharp
// Get all images from the document
WordProcessingContent content = watermarker.GetContent<WordProcessingContent>();
foreach (var image in content.Images)
{
    // Apply watermark to each image
    image.Add(watermark);
}
```

### Step 4: Save Your Watermarked Document

Finally, save your changes by outputting the modified Word document.

```csharp
// Define the output path and save the watermarked document
watermarker.Save("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\output_document.docx");
```

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- **File Access Issues**: Ensure you have read/write permissions for the directories involved.
- **Image Format Compatibility**: GroupDocs.Watermark supports a wide range of image formats, but always check compatibility.

2. **Branding**: Add your company logo or tagline as a watermark for brand consistency across all corporate documents.
3. **Copyright Protection**: Deter unauthorized use of your presentation materials and reports.
