## Implementation Guide
This section details how to add and customize text watermarks using GroupDocs.Watermark.

### Adding Text Watermarks
#### Overview
Adding a text watermark involves creating a `TextWatermark` object, configuring its properties, and then applying it to your document. 

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
**1. Define Font for the Watermark:**
Select an appropriate font style that suits your branding or security needs.
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Watermarks;

Font font = new Font("Arial", 19, FontStyle.Bold | FontStyle.Italic);
```

**2. Create and Configure `TextWatermark` Object:**
Create a watermark with desired text and configure its appearance.
```csharp
TextWatermark watermark = new TextWatermark("Test watermark", font)
{
    ForegroundColor = Color.Red,
    BackgroundColor = Color.Blue,
    TextAlignment = TextAlignment.Right,
    Opacity = 0.5 // Adjust opacity for visibility
};
```

**3. Add Watermark to Document:**
Use the `Add` method to incorporate the watermark into your document.
```csharp
watermarker.Add(watermark);
```

**4. Save the Output Document:**
Ensure changes are saved with a distinct file name or path.
```csharp
string outputFileName = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/InImagePng_WithWatermark.png";
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```

### Customizing Watermark Appearance
#### Overview
Customization allows you to tweak the watermark's look and feel, enhancing document security or branding visibility.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
**1. Adjust Text Color and Background:**
Fine-tune colors for better contrast and readability.
```csharp
watermark.ForegroundColor = Color.Green;
watermark.BackgroundColor = Color.Transparent;
```

**2. Align Watermark Text:**
Choose alignment based on your document layout needs.
```csharp
watermark.TextAlignment = TextAlignment.Center;
```

**3. Modify Opacity for Optimal Visibility:**
Increase or decrease opacity to make the watermark more or less prominent.
```csharp
watermark.Opacity = 0.8;
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Missing Font Issues:** Ensure the font is installed on your system.
- **Color Display Problems:** Verify RGB values for compatibility with different document types.
