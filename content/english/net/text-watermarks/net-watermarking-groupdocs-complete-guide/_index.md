- **Knowledge Prerequisites:** Basic understanding of C# programming and familiarity with file handling in .NET will be beneficial.
## Setting Up GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET
To begin, you'll need to install the GroupDocs.Watermark library. Here’s how you can do it using different methods:
**.NET CLI**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Watermark
```
**Package Manager Console**
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Watermark
```
**NuGet Package Manager UI**

### License Acquisition
- **Free Trial:** Start with a free trial to explore the library's features.
- **Temporary License:** Obtain a temporary license if you need more time to evaluate the product.
- **Purchase:** For long-term use, consider purchasing a full license.
#### Basic Initialization
Once installed, initialize GroupDocs.Watermark in your application:
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark;
```
## Implementation Guide
Let's break down the watermarking process into manageable features.
### Load Document from Stream
**Overview:** This feature focuses on creating a Watermarker instance for documents loaded as streams, ideal for handling large files or cloud storage documents efficiently.
#### Step 1: Open the Document as a Stream
```csharp
using System.IO;
string documentPath = Path.Combine(@"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "InDocumentDocx");

// Open the document as a stream
using (Stream document = File.OpenRead(documentPath))
{
    // Proceed to create a Watermarker instance
}
```
#### Step 2: Create a Watermarker Instance
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Watermarks;

// Create a Watermarker instance with the document stream
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(document))
{
    // Add watermark and save
}
```
### Create Text Watermark
**Overview:** This feature demonstrates how to create a text watermark using specific font settings for customization.
#### Step 1: Define Text and Styling
```csharp
using System.Drawing;

// Define the text and styling for the watermark
string watermarkText = "Test watermark";
Font watermarkFont = new Font("Arial", 12);
```
#### Step 2: Create a TextWatermark Object
```csharp
// Create a TextWatermark object with specified text and font
TextWatermark watermark = new TextWatermark(watermarkText, watermarkFont);
```
### Save Watermarked Document
**Overview:** This section covers how to save your document after adding watermarks.
#### Step 1: Define Output File Path
```csharp
string outputFileName = Path.Combine(@"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "WatermarkedDocument.docx");
```
#### Step 2: Save the Document
```csharp
// Assuming 'watermarker' is an instance of Watermarker with added watermarks
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```
### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Stream Errors:** Ensure your stream is correctly opened and closed to avoid file access issues.
- **Font Issues:** Verify that the font used in watermarking is installed on your system.
## Practical Applications
Here are some real-world scenarios where GroupDocs.Watermark can be particularly useful:
1. **Document Security:** Watermark confidential documents before sharing them with external parties.
2. **Watermarking Images and PDFs:** Use similar techniques to add watermarks to images or PDF files, enhancing security across various formats.
3. **Batch Processing:** Automate watermarking of multiple documents in bulk for efficiency.
## Performance Considerations
To optimize the performance of GroupDocs.Watermark:
- Manage memory effectively by disposing of streams and objects promptly.
- For large-scale applications, consider processing documents asynchronously to improve responsiveness.
