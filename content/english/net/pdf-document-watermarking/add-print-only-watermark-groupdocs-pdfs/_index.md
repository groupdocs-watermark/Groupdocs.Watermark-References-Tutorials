## Setting Up GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET

To begin using GroupDocs.Watermark, you must first install it. Here's how to set up the library:

**Using .NET CLI:**

dotnet add package GroupDocs.Watermark
```

**Package Manager Console in Visual Studio:**

### License Acquisition Steps
Before starting, consider how you want to use GroupDocs.Watermark:
- **Free Trial:** Ideal for testing out features.

```

## Implementation Guide

Let's implement the print-only watermark feature step-by-step.

### Adding a Print-Only Watermark to PDFs

#### Overview
This section demonstrates adding a watermark visible only when printing, maintaining clarity in digital views.

##### Step 1: Prepare Your Document Paths
Start by defining your input and output file paths:

```csharp
string documentPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "input.pdf");
string outputPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "output_with_watermark.pdf");
```

##### Step 2: Initialize Watermarker and Define Options
Initialize the `Watermarker` instance with your PDF file, preparing watermark options for print-only visibility.

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options.Pdf;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Watermarks;

PdfLoadOptions loadOptions = new PdfLoadOptions();
Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions);

TextWatermark textWatermark = new TextWatermark("Confidential", new Font("Arial", 36))
{
    ForegroundColor = Color.Gray,
    BackgroundColor = Color.Transparent,
    Opacity = 0.5,
    RotateAngle = 45
};
```

##### Step 3: Configure Print-Only Visibility
Set the watermark to be visible only in print mode by configuring its appearance options.

```csharp
PdfArtifactWatermarkOptions watermarkOptions = new PdfArtifactWatermarkOptions();
watermarkOptions.ArtifactAppearanceMode = ArtifactAppearanceMode.OnPrint;
textWatermark.WatermarkSettings.PdfTextFormatting.PdfVisibility = PdfTextVisibility.PrintOnly;

// Add the watermark to all pages
foreach (var page in watermarker.Pages)
{
    page.Add(textWatermark, watermarkOptions);
}
```

##### Step 4: Save and Close
After applying the watermark, save your changes and close the `Watermarker` instance.

```csharp
watermarker.Save(outputPath);
watermarker.Dispose();
```

**Troubleshooting Tips:** Ensure that paths are correctly set and dependencies are resolved. If watermarks do not appear as expected in print previews, double-check visibility settings.

## Practical Applications

Here are some real-world applications for this feature:
1. **Confidential Documents:** Add confidential notes visible only when printed to ensure they don't clutter the digital view.
2. **Branding:** Embed a company logo on all client-facing documents that appear during printing but not in digital formats.
3. **Version Control:** Mark internal drafts with version numbers or dates that are visible only in printouts.

Integration possibilities include embedding these watermarks within document management systems to maintain consistent branding across departments.

## Performance Considerations

When using GroupDocs.Watermark, consider the following for optimal performance:
- **Batch Processing:** Process documents in batches to improve efficiency.
- **Resource Management:** Always dispose of `Watermarker` instances promptly to free up resources.
- **Memory Usage:** For large PDFs, ensure adequate memory allocation and monitor your application's resource consumption.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've explored how to add print-only watermarks to PDF documents using GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET. This feature enhances document security and professional presentation without sacrificing on-screen clarity. As next steps, consider experimenting with different watermark styles or integrating these techniques into larger projects.
