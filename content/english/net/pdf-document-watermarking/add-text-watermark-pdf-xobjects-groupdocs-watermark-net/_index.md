## Introduction

In today's digital landscape, protecting intellectual property is paramount. Whether distributing confidential documents or creative content, watermarks can safeguard PDF files against unauthorized use. This guide demonstrates how to add text watermarks seamlessly to all image XObjects within a PDF document using **GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET**.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Installing and setting up GroupDocs.Watermark in your .NET environment
- Adding text watermarks to PDF XObjects
- Customizing watermark appearance with various configuration options

Let's dive into effectively protecting your documents. Ensure you have the prerequisites covered before starting.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure you have:
- **GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET** installed in your development environment.
- A basic understanding of C# and .NET programming.
- Visual Studio or a similar IDE set up on your machine.

These components are essential to follow the steps outlined in this guide. If you're new to GroupDocs.Watermark, we'll walk through everything from setup to implementation.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET

### Installation Instructions

To install GroupDocs.Watermark, choose one of these methods:

**.NET CLI:**
```shell
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Watermark
```

**Package Manager:**
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Watermark
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI:**
Search for "GroupDocs.Watermark" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition

Start by acquiring a free trial license to explore the features. For long-term use, consider purchasing a license or obtaining a temporary one from [here](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/).

### Basic Initialization

Initialize your GroupDocs.Watermark setup with these steps:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark;
```

Create an instance of `Watermarker` to begin working with PDF documents.

## Implementation Guide

This guide walks you through adding text watermarks to all image XObjects in a PDF document using GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET.

### Step 1: Define Input and Output Paths

Set up paths for your input PDF file and the output directory:

```csharp
string documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"; // Replace with actual PDF path
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"; // Output directory path
string outputFileName = System.IO.Path.Combine(outputDirectory, System.IO.Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
```

### Step 2: Load the PDF File

Load your PDF file using `PdfLoadOptions` to prepare for watermarking:

```csharp
var loadOptions = new PdfLoadOptions();
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // Proceed with further steps...
}
```

### Step 3: Initialize TextWatermark

Create a `TextWatermark` object with your desired text and properties:

```csharp
TextWatermark watermark = new TextWatermark("Protected image", new Font("Arial", 8));
watermark.HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Center;
watermark.VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Center;
watermark.RotateAngle = 45; // Rotation angle of the watermark
watermark.SizingType = SizingType.ScaleToParentDimensions;
watermark.ScaleFactor = 1;
```

### Step 4: Iterate Over Pages and XObjects

Loop through each page and its image XObjects to apply the watermark:

```csharp
PdfContent pdfContent = watermarker.GetContent<PdfContent>();
foreach (PdfPage page in pdfContent.Pages)
{
    foreach (PdfXObject xObject in page.XObjects)
    {
        if (xObject.Image != null) // Check if the XObject is an image
        {
            xObject.Image.Add(watermark);
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 5: Save the Watermarked PDF

Save your watermarked document to the specified output path:

```csharp
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```

## Practical Applications

1. **Document Protection:** Secure confidential business documents before sharing them with clients.
2. **Brand Visibility:** Add company logos or names as watermarks on promotional material.
3. **Content Deterrent:** Prevent unauthorized distribution of copyrighted materials.

Consider integrating this functionality into document management systems or content delivery networks to automate watermarking processes.

## Performance Considerations

When using GroupDocs.Watermark, consider these tips for optimal performance:
- Limit the number of watermarks added per page to maintain processing speed.
- Manage memory efficiently by disposing of `Watermarker` objects after use.

Adhere to best practices for .NET memory management, ensuring that resources are freed when no longer needed.
