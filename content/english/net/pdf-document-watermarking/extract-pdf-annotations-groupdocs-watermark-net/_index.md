### License Acquisition

Before using GroupDocs.Watermark, obtain a license:
- **Free Trial**: Test the library's capabilities with a free trial download.
- **Temporary License**: Request for extended evaluation purposes.
- **Purchase**: Buy a license if deploying in production environments.

### Basic Initialization

After installation, initialize GroupDocs.Watermark as follows:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark;
using System;

namespace PdfAnnotationExtractor
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Initialize Watermarker with a PDF document path
            using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker("sample.pdf"))
            {
                Console.WriteLine("GroupDocs.Watermark initialized.");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Extracting Annotations from PDFs

Extracting annotations allows you to access and manipulate metadata within PDF files. This involves iterating through each page, identifying annotations, and capturing details such as type, text content, dimensions, position, and any associated images.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**3.1 Initialize GroupDocs.Watermark**

Create a `Watermarker` instance to work with your PDF file:

```csharp
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker("sample.pdf"))
{
    // Your code here
}
```

**3.2 Load Annotations from the Document**

Access and iterate through annotations using GroupDocs.Watermark methods:

```csharp
// Access all annotations in the PDF
var annotations = watermarker.GetContent<PdfAnnotation>().Annotations;
foreach (var annotation in annotations)
{
    // Extract and print details of each annotation
    Console.WriteLine($"Type: {annotation.AnnotationType}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Text: {annotation.Text}");
}
```

**3.3 Capture Annotation Details**

Access properties within the `PdfAnnotation` object for specific details:

```csharp
foreach (var annotation in annotations)
{
    // Extract additional properties
    var location = annotation.Location;
    Console.WriteLine($"Position: X={location.X}, Y={location.Y}");
    
    if (annotation is PdfImageAnnotation imageAnnotation)
    {
        // Handle image annotations specifically
        Console.WriteLine("Contains Image");
    }
}
```

**3.4 Error Handling and Troubleshooting**

Ensure proper exception handling for common issues like file access errors or unsupported annotation types:

```csharp
try
{
    // Annotation processing code
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"An error occurred: {ex.Message}");
}
```

## Practical Applications

GroupDocs.Watermark's capabilities extend beyond simple extraction, offering numerous practical applications:
1. **Document Review Systems**: Automate annotation extraction and categorization for efficient review processes.
2. **E-Learning Platforms**: Capture student notes and highlights within PDF lecture materials.
3. **Legal Document Management**: Extract lawyer annotations for easy reference during case reviews.

## Performance Considerations

When working with large documents or numerous files, optimizing performance is crucial:
- **Efficient Resource Use**: Minimize memory usage by disposing of objects promptly.
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple documents in batches to reduce overhead.
- **Async Operations**: Utilize asynchronous methods where possible to improve responsiveness.

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you've learned how to extract annotation information from PDFs using GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET. These skills enable you to integrate powerful document processing features into your applications, enhancing both functionality and user experience.

As a next step, explore the extensive documentation provided by GroupDocs to refine your implementation further. Don't hesitate to reach out to their support forums if you encounter any challenges.
