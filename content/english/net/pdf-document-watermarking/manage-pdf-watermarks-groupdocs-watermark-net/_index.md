With the **GroupDocs.Watermark .NET** library, this task becomes straightforward and efficient. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to search for both image and text watermarks in PDFs and remove them using GroupDocs.Watermark. By the end of this guide, you will have a clear understanding of how to implement these functionalities seamlessly.

### What You'll Learn:
- How to initialize watermark search criteria for images and text.
- Techniques to execute watermark searches and removal on specific PDF pages.
- Best practices for optimizing performance with GroupDocs.Watermark in .NET applications.

Let's dive into the prerequisites required before getting started.
## Prerequisites
Before we jump into coding, ensure that your environment is set up correctly. Here’s what you’ll need:

### Required Libraries:
- **GroupDocs.Watermark** - The primary library for watermarking functionalities.

### Versions and Dependencies:
- .NET Framework 4.7.2 or later (or .NET Core/5+/6+).

### Environment Setup Requirements:
- Visual Studio 2019 or later.

### Knowledge Prerequisites:
- Basic understanding of C# programming.
- Familiarity with handling PDFs in a .NET environment is beneficial but not mandatory.
## Setting Up GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET
To get started, you need to install the **GroupDocs.Watermark** library. Here are various methods to do so:
### Installation Methods
#### .NET CLI
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Watermark
```
#### Package Manager Console
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Watermark
```
#### NuGet Package Manager UI
- Open your project in Visual Studio.
- Go to **Tools** > **NuGet Package Manager** > **Manage NuGet Packages for Solution**.
- Search for "GroupDocs.Watermark" and install the latest version.
### License Acquisition
You can start with a free trial or acquire a temporary license to explore all features. For long-term use, consider purchasing a subscription:
- Visit [GroupDocs License Page](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/) for more details on acquiring licenses.
### Basic Initialization and Setup
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark;

// Initialize Watermarker with your document path
var watermarker = new Watermarker("YOUR_DOCUMENT_PATH");
```
## Implementation Guide
We'll break down the implementation into logical sections to make it easy to follow.
### Feature 1: Initialize Watermark Search Criteria
This feature demonstrates how to set up search criteria for both image and text watermarks in a PDF file.
#### Overview
You will learn to initialize an image watermark search using DCT hash and text watermark search for specific text strings.
##### Step 1: Include Necessary Namespaces
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Contents.Pdf;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options.Pdf;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Search;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Search.SearchCriteria;
```
##### Step 2: Set Up Search Criteria
```csharp
var documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
var loadOptions = new PdfLoadOptions();

// Initialize image search criteria using DCT hash
ImageSearchCriteria imageSearchCriteria = new ImageDctHashSearchCriteria(Path.Combine(documentPath, "logo.png"));

// Initialize text search criteria for specific text
TextSearchCriteria textSearchCriteria = new TextSearchCriteria("Company Name");
```
- **ImageDctHashSearchCriteria**: This class uses DCT hashing to find similar images.
- **TextSearchCriteria**: Searches for exact text matches.
### Feature 2: Execute Watermark Search and Removal on PDF
Now, let's focus on searching and removing watermarks from a specific page in your PDF document.
#### Overview
Learn how to identify and remove both image and text watermarks using the criteria defined earlier.
##### Step 1: Initialize Your Document and Load Options
```csharp
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    PdfContent pdfContent = watermarker.GetContent<PdfContent>();
}
```
##### Step 2: Search for Watermarks on the First Page
```csharp
PossibleWatermarkCollection possibleWatermarks = pdfContent.Pages[0].Search(imageSearchCriteria.Or(textSearchCriteria));
```
- **Pages[0]**: Targets the first page of your PDF document.
- **Or()**: Combines both image and text search criteria.
##### Step 3: Remove Identified Watermarks
```csharp
for (int i = possibleWatermarks.Count - 1; i >= 0; i--)
{
    possibleWatermarks.RemoveAt(i);
}
```
##### Step 4: Save the Updated Document
```csharp
string outputFileName = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```
## Practical Applications
GroupDocs.Watermark can be used in various scenarios:
1. **Removing Unwanted Watermarks**: Perfect for cleaning up documents before sharing.
2. **Batch Processing**: Automate watermark removal across multiple PDFs efficiently.
3. **Compliance and Legal Document Preparation**: Ensure documents meet legal standards by removing sensitive watermarks.
Integration with document management systems or workflows is also a possibility, enhancing automation and productivity in enterprise environments.
## Performance Considerations
When working with GroupDocs.Watermark:
- **Optimize Memory Usage**: Dispose of `Watermarker` objects properly to free up resources.
- **Batch Process Documents**: Handle multiple documents sequentially to avoid memory overload.
- **Adjust Search Criteria Sensitivity**: Fine-tune your search criteria for more efficient processing.
## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we explored how to manage watermarks in PDFs using GroupDocs.Watermark .NET. You've learned how to set up search criteria and remove unwanted watermarks from specific pages. For further exploration, consider experimenting with different watermark types and integrating these solutions into larger document management systems.
