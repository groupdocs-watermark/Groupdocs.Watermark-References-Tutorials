# How to Add Text and Image Watermarks to PDFs Using GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET

## Introduction

Watermarking is a crucial feature for protecting your documents, whether by marking them as confidential or branding them with a company logo or text. Adding watermarks can deter unauthorized use, maintain document integrity, and provide traceability. In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to add both text and image watermarks to PDF files using GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET.

**What You’ll Learn:**
- How to implement text and image watermarking in PDFs with GroupDocs.Watermark.
- Steps to set up your development environment for using GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET.
- Key configuration options available within the library.
- Practical applications of watermarks in real-world scenarios.

Let’s start by setting up our prerequisites.

## Prerequisites
Before diving into implementation, ensure you have the necessary setup:

1. **Required Libraries and Versions:**
   - GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET (latest version).
   - .NET Framework or .NET Core/5+ environment.
   
2. **Environment Setup Requirements:**
   - A development environment like Visual Studio.

3. **Knowledge Prerequisites:**
   - Basic understanding of C# and .NET application development.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET
To get started with GroupDocs.Watermark, you first need to install the package in your project:

**Using .NET CLI:**

```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Watermark
```

**Package Manager Console:**

```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Watermark
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI:**
- Search for "GroupDocs.Watermark" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition
To use GroupDocs.Watermark, you can start with a free trial or request a temporary license to evaluate all features without limitations. For ongoing usage, consider purchasing a license from [GroupDocs](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/).

### Basic Initialization and Setup
Here's how to initialize the library in your project:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark;
// Initialize with default options.
Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker("path/to/document.pdf");
```

## Implementation Guide
We’ll break down the implementation into two main features: adding text and image watermarks.

### Adding Text Watermark to PDF Document
#### Overview
Adding a text watermark involves overlaying custom text on your document, useful for branding or marking confidential documents.

#### Steps:
**1. Initialize Your Project:**
Ensure you have the GroupDocs.Watermark package installed and imported into your project.

```csharp
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Common;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options.Pdf;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Watermarks;
using System.Drawing;

string documentPath = "@YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.pdf";
string outputDirectory = "@YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFileName = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
var loadOptions = new PdfLoadOptions();
```

**2. Configure Watermark Options:**
Set up the watermark properties and how it should appear on your document.

```csharp
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    PdfAnnotationWatermarkOptions options = new PdfAnnotationWatermarkOptions();

    TextWatermark textWatermark = new TextWatermark("This is an annotation watermark", new Font("Arial", 8));
    textWatermark.HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Left;
    textWatermark.VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Top;

    watermarker.Add(textWatermark, options);

    watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
}
```
- **Parameters:**
  - `HorizontalAlignment` and `VerticalAlignment`: Control the position of your watermark.
  - `TextWatermark`: The content and appearance settings of the text.

**3. Save Your Document:**
Ensure the document is saved with the applied changes.

### Adding Image Watermark to PDF Document
#### Overview
Image watermarks are ideal for adding logos or graphical elements to your documents, enhancing both security and branding.

#### Steps:
**1. Prepare Your Environment:**
Just like text watermarking, start by setting up your project environment.

```csharp
string documentPath = "@YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.pdf";
string outputDirectory = "@YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFileName = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
var loadOptions = new PdfLoadOptions();
```

**2. Load and Configure Image Watermark:**
Use an image file to create the watermark.

```csharp
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    PdfAnnotationWatermarkOptions options = new PdfAnnotationWatermarkOptions();

    using (ImageWatermark imageWatermark = new ImageWatermark("@YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/protect.jpg"))
    {
        imageWatermark.HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Right;
        imageWatermark.VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Top;

        watermarker.Add(imageWatermark, options);
    }

    watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
}
```
- **Key Configuration Options:**
  - `ImageWatermark`: Specifies the path and properties of your watermark image.

**3. Save Your Document:**
Finalize by saving the document with the new watermark.

## Practical Applications
1. **Document Security:** Use watermarks to label confidential documents, reducing unauthorized sharing risks.
2. **Branding:** Embed company logos on promotional PDFs to enhance brand visibility.
3. **Copyright Protection:** Mark original content in digital publications.
4. **Education Materials:** Watermark student submissions for traceability and authentication.
5. **Legal Documents:** Clearly mark legal papers as confidential or draft versions.

## Performance Considerations
- **Optimization Tips:**
  - Use efficient file handling to minimize memory usage.
  - Only watermark necessary pages rather than the entire document when possible.
  
- **Resource Usage Guidelines:**
  - Ensure your application releases resources properly by using `using` statements.
  
- **Best Practices:**
  - Regularly update GroupDocs.Watermark to benefit from performance improvements and bug fixes.

## Conclusion
By following this guide, you’ve learned how to add both text and image watermarks to PDF documents using GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET. Experiment with different configurations and explore the library's documentation for more advanced features.

For further exploration, consider integrating these watermarks into your document management systems or automating watermarking processes within your application workflow.
