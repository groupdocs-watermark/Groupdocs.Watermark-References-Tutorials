## Implementation Guide

We'll break down the process into three key features: loading a PDF document, editing text within XObjects, and saving the modified document.

### Feature 1: Load PDF Document

**Overview**: This feature demonstrates how to load a PDF document using GroupDocs.Watermark.

#### Step 1: Define File Path
Start by specifying the path to your PDF file:

```csharp
string documentPath = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\document.pdf";
```

#### Step 2: Load the Document
Utilize `PdfLoadOptions` and `Watermarker` to load your PDF content into a `PdfContent` object.

```csharp
var loadOptions = new PdfLoadOptions();
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    PdfContent pdfContent = watermarker.GetContent<PdfContent>();
}
```

### Feature 2: Edit and Replace Text in XObject

**Overview**: Learn how to find and replace text within a specific XObject of your PDF document.

#### Step 1: Access XObjects
Navigate through the first page's XObjects:

```csharp
PdfContent pdfContent = watermarker.GetContent<PdfContent>();
foreach (PdfXObject xObject in pdfContent.Pages[0].XObjects)
{
    // Check if the text contains 'Test' and replace it with 'Passed'.
    if (xObject.Text.Contains("Test"))
    {
        xObject.Text = "Passed";
    }
}
```

**Explanation**: This snippet iterates through XObjects to find any instance of the string "Test" and replaces it with "Passed".

### Feature 3: Save Modified PDF Document

**Overview**: Finally, save your changes back to a new or existing PDF file.

#### Step 1: Define Output Path
Specify where you want to save the modified document:

```csharp
string outputFileName = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY\
