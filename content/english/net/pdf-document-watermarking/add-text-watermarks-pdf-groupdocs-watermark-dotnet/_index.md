## Prerequisites (H2)

Before diving into the implementation, let's cover what you'll need to get started:

### Required Libraries, Versions, and Dependencies
- **GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET**: Ensure you have this library installed in your project. It’s crucial for adding watermarks to documents.
  
### Environment Setup Requirements
- A development environment supporting .NET applications (e.g., Visual Studio).
- Basic understanding of C# programming.

### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Familiarity with .NET application development and file handling is beneficial but not mandatory.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET (H2)

To begin, you need to install the GroupDocs.Watermark library in your project. Here’s how:

**.NET CLI**
```shell
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Watermark
```

**Package Manager Console**
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Watermark
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI**
- Search for "GroupDocs.Watermark" in the NuGet Package Manager and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition Steps

- **Free Trial**: You can start with a free trial to evaluate the library's capabilities.
- **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license if you need more time for evaluation.
- **Purchase**: If it fits your needs, consider purchasing a full license to unlock all features without limitations.

### Basic Initialization and Setup

After installing the package, initialize GroupDocs.Watermark in your project. Here's an example:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark;

// Initialize Watermarker with the path to your document
Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker("path/to/your/document.pdf");
```

## Implementation Guide (H2)

Now, let’s delve into how you can add text watermarks to your PDFs using GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET.

### Step 1: Define Paths

Start by defining the paths for your source and output documents:

```csharp
string documentPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "your_document.pdf");
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFileName = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
```

### Step 2: Initialize Watermarker

Initialize the `Watermarker` object with your PDF file:

```csharp
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath))
{
    // Code for adding watermark will go here
}
```

### Step 3: Set Up Font Properties

Choose a font style and size for your watermark text. This step determines how the text appears on the document:

```csharp
Font font = new Font("Arial", 19, FontStyle.Bold | FontStyle.Italic);
```

### Step 4: Create TextWatermark Object

Create a `TextWatermark` object with your desired text and font settings:

```csharp
TextWatermark watermark = new TextWatermark("Test watermark", font);
```

### Step 5: Configure Watermark Properties

Customize the appearance of your watermark by setting its color, alignment, and opacity:

```csharp
watermark.ForegroundColor = Color.Red;
watermark.TextAlignment = TextAlignment.Right;
watermark.Opacity = 0.5;
```

### Step 6: Add Watermark to Document

Add the configured watermark to your document:

```csharp
var result = watermarker.Add(watermark);
```

### Step 7: Log Watermark Information (Optional)

For clarity, you can log details about the added watermarks:

```csharp
foreach (var item in result.Succeeded) 
{
    Console.WriteLine("WatermarkId: {0}", item.WatermarkId);
    Console.WriteLine("WatermarkType: {0}", item.WatermarkType);
    Console.WriteLine("PageNumber: {0}", item.PageNumber);
    Console.WriteLine("WatermarkPosition: {0}", item.WatermarkPosition);
}
```

### Step 8: Save the Watermarked Document

Finally, save your document with the added watermark:

```csharp
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```

## Practical Applications (H2)

Here are some real-world use cases for adding watermarks to PDFs:

1. **Document Security**: Prevent unauthorized copying or distribution of sensitive information.
2. **Branding**: Add company logos or names to all outgoing documents for brand recognition.
3. **Copyright Protection**: Mark ownership on creative works like brochures and reports.

## Performance Considerations (H2)

- **Optimizing Performance**: Minimize resource usage by watermarking only necessary pages.
- **Memory Management**: Dispose of `Watermarker` objects promptly to free up memory.
- **Best Practices**: Use efficient file paths and handle exceptions gracefully.

## Conclusion

You've now learned how to add text watermarks to PDFs using GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET. With these skills, you can enhance document security and branding in your applications. Consider exploring additional features of the library to further customize your watermarks.
