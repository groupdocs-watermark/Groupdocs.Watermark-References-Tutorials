#### Basic Initialization and Setup
Once installed, initialize the library in your project like this:
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Common;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Contents.Pdf;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options.Pdf;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Watermarks;
// Initialize watermarker with a document path and load options
var loadOptions = new PdfLoadOptions();
string documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"; // Replace with actual path

using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // Further processing will go here
}
```
Now that you have your environment set up, let's delve into the implementation.
## Implementation Guide
### Adding a Text Watermark to PDFs
This section demonstrates how to add text watermarks to your PDF files using GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET. Here’s what we’ll cover:
#### Overview
Adding a text watermark involves creating an instance of `TextWatermark` and applying it to the desired locations within your PDF document.
#### Step-by-Step Implementation
##### Initialize Watermarker Object
Start by loading your PDF document using the `Watermarker` class, which allows you to manage watermarks in your file.
```csharp
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    PdfContent pdfContent = watermarker.GetContent<PdfContent>();
}
```
##### Create and Configure Text Watermark
Next, initialize a `TextWatermark` object with the desired text. Customize its appearance by setting properties like font size, color, and opacity.
```csharp
// Initialize a text watermark with your custom text
TextWatermark watermark = new TextWatermark("Protected image", new Font("Arial", 12))
{
    ForegroundColor = Color.Blue,
    BackgroundColor = Color.Yellow,
    Opacity = 0.5,
    RotateAngle = 45
};
```
##### Apply the Watermark
Once configured, apply this watermark to your PDF using appropriate methods provided by the `Watermarker` class.
```csharp
// Add the watermark to all pages in the document
watermarker.Add(watermark);
```
##### Save the Document
Finally, save the watermarked PDF to a specified location.
```csharp
// Save the output PDF with watermarks
string outputPath = "output.pdf";
watermarker.Save(outputPath);
```
### Troubleshooting Tips
- **File Not Found:** Ensure your document path is correct and accessible.
- **Library Compatibility Issues:** Make sure you're using compatible versions of GroupDocs.Watermark and .NET.
## Practical Applications
Adding text watermarks can serve various purposes:
1. **Document Security:** Mark confidential documents to prevent unauthorized distribution.
2. **Copyright Protection:** Assert ownership over your intellectual property.
3. **Branding:** Add company logos or branding elements to official documentation.
4. **Version Control:** Mark draft versions of documents with "DRAFT" watermarks.
## Performance Considerations
For optimal performance:
- Limit the number of watermarks per document to reduce processing time.
- Manage memory usage by disposing of objects properly and using `using` statements in C#.
- Utilize multi-threading for batch processing of large numbers of documents.
## Conclusion
You've now mastered adding text watermarks to PDF files with GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET. This capability not only secures your documents but also enhances their professional appearance.
**Next Steps:**
Explore further customization options, integrate this functionality into larger applications, or explore other watermark types available in the library.
