# How to Add a Text Watermark to an Image Using GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET: A Step-by-Step Guide

## Introduction

Creating visually appealing and secure images often requires overlaying watermarks that deliver branding or confidentiality messages. Whether you're a developer building a document management system or simply want to customize images for presentations, the GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET library offers powerful, easy-to-use tools to add watermarks seamlessly. In this tutorial, I'll walk you through the step-by-step process of adding a text watermark to an image using this versatile library. By the end, you'll be equipped with a clear understanding and practical code to incorporate watermarks into your .NET applications.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into coding, ensure your environment is set up correctly:

- **.NET Environment**: You should have a working .NET Framework or .NET Core project.
- **GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET Installed**: Download and install the library via NuGet Package Manager or from [GroupDocs Releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/watermark/net/)
- **Sample Image**: Have an image file ready to add a watermark to—be it PNG, JPEG, etc.
- **References**: Add references to GroupDocs.Watermark in your project.

## Import Packages

Start by importing the necessary namespaces. These give your code access to classes for font management, colors, and watermarking operations:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Drawing;
using GroupDocs.Watermark;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Drawing;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Contents;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options;
```

Now you’re ready to proceed with the actual watermarking process.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Add Text Watermark to an Image

### 1. Load Your Image Document

The first step involves specifying the path to your image and initializing the Watermarker object, which handles all watermarking tasks.

```csharp
string imagePath = "path_to_your_image.jpg"; // Replace with your image path
string outputDirectory = "output_directory_path"; // Specify output directory
string outputFileName = System.IO.Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "watermarked_image.jpg"); // Output file
```

Think of this as opening the file you want to work on — setting the stage for your watermarking magic.

### 2. Initialize the Watermarker

Create an instance of the Watermarker class, opening your image for editing.

```csharp
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(imagePath))
{
    // Your code will go here
}
```

This is like holding your image in your hands so you can work on it.

### 3. Configure Text Font and Style

Choose a font style that matches your design goals. Here, we use Arial, size 19, with bold and italic styles.

```csharp
Font font = new Font("Arial", 19, FontStyle.Bold | FontStyle.Italic);
```

Fonts are the voice of your watermark — bold, subtle, playful — pick what speaks for your message.

### 4. Create the Text Watermark

Initialize your watermark text object with the message you want.

```csharp
TextWatermark watermark = new TextWatermark("Sample Watermark", font);
```

Think of this as writing your message on a transparent sheet before placing it on the image.

### 5. Customize Tile Options for Repeating Watermark

Control how the watermark tiles across your image — whether it repeats straight lines, rotates, or aligns differently.

```csharp
watermark.TileOptions = new TileOptions()
{
    TileType = TileType.Straight,
    RotateAroundOrigin = true,
    LineSpacing = new MeasureValue()
    {
        MeasureType = TileMeasureType.Percent,
        Value = 12
    },
    WatermarkSpacing = new MeasureValue()
    {
        MeasureType = TileMeasureType.Percent,
        Value = 10
    },
};
```

This is like choosing whether your watermark appears as a single stamp or a repeating pattern across the image.

### 6. Set the Watermark Appearance

Define the colors, alignment, transparency (opacity), and rotation of your watermark.

```csharp
watermark.ForegroundColor = Color.Red;        // Text color
watermark.BackgroundColor = Color.Blue;       // Background behind text
watermark.TextAlignment = TextAlignment.Right; // Alignment within text box
watermark.Opacity = 0.4;                       // 40% transparent
watermark.RotateAngle = 45;                    // Rotate 45 degrees
```

Colors and transparency are like makeup — you decide how prominent or subtle your watermark appears.

### 7. Add the Watermark to Your Image

Finally, embed the watermark onto the image.

```csharp
watermarker.Add(watermark);
```

This step is akin to affixing your watermarked label onto the picture.

### 8. Save the Watermarked Image

Save your edited image with the watermark into your designated output path.

```csharp
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
Console.WriteLine($"Successfully added watermark. Check {outputFileName}");
```

Now, your image is ready with an embedded watermark — like a supercharged signature.

## Wrapping Up

- Load your image in a Watermarker object.
- Configure font and style.
- Create and customize your text watermark.
- Apply tiling and appearance options.
- Embed the watermark and save your image.

This process can be extended and customized—think of it as customizing your stamp to fit each masterpiece.
