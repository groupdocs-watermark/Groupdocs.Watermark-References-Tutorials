### Knowledge Prerequisites

A basic understanding of C# and familiarity with .NET project structures will help you follow along more easily.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET

To get started, you need to install the GroupDocs.Watermark package. You can do this using different methods depending on your preference:

### .NET CLI

- **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license for extended testing.
- **Purchase**: For commercial use, purchase a license through GroupDocs.

### Basic Initialization and Setup

Initialize your project by creating an instance of the `Watermarker` class. This will be used throughout to manage watermark operations on your documents:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options.Presentation;

// Initialize Watermarker with the file path
Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker("presentation.pptx");
```

## Implementation Guide

### Adding a Text Watermark to PowerPoint Presentations

#### Overview

This feature allows you to add textual watermarks, such as company logos or confidentiality notices, directly onto each slide in your PowerPoint presentation.

#### Step 1: Prepare Your Environment

First, ensure that the GroupDocs.Watermark library is correctly installed and set up in your project. Import necessary namespaces:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options.Presentation;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Watermarks;
```

#### Step 2: Load Your Presentation

Initialize a `Watermarker` object with the path to your presentation file.

```csharp
string documentPath = "presentation.pptx"; // Ensure this is your correct file path
Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath);
```

#### Step 3: Create and Customize Your Watermark

Create a text watermark by instantiating `TextWatermark` with desired properties:

```csharp
TextWatermark watermark = new TextWatermark("Confidential", new Font("Arial", 36))
{
    RotateAngle = -45,
    Opacity = 0.5,
    ForegroundColor = Color.Blue
};
```

#### Step 4: Add the Watermark to Your Presentation

Use `PresentationWatermarkSlideOptions` to apply the watermark across all slides:

```csharp
watermarker.Add(watermark, new PresentationWatermarkSlideOptions());
```

#### Step 5: Save and Close the Watermarked Document

Save your changes and properly dispose of resources:

```csharp
string outputFileName = "watermarked_presentation.pptx";
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
watermarker.Dispose();
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **File Path Issues**: Ensure that paths are correctly set, especially if dealing with relative paths.
- **Missing Fonts**: Check the availability of fonts on your machine.

## Practical Applications

1. **Confidentiality Notices**: Automatically add "For Internal Use Only" to sensitive presentations.
2. **Branding Elements**: Embed company logos or names subtly across all slides for brand consistency.
3. **Event Watermarks**: Add event-specific watermarks like "2023 Annual Conference" during bulk processing of related presentations.

## Performance Considerations

- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple files simultaneously by leveraging multi-threading where applicable.
- **Resource Management**: Always close and dispose of `Watermarker` objects to free up memory.
- **Optimization**: Use lower resolution images for watermarks to reduce processing time.

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you've learned how to effectively use GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET to add text watermarks to PowerPoint presentations. As you become more familiar with the API, explore additional features like image watermarking or applying watermarks to different document types.
