## Implementation Guide

Let’s walk through adding text watermarks to images within PowerPoint slides.

### Step 1: Set Up Paths and Load Options
Firstly, define the paths for your input document and where you want to save the output. Then, set up any necessary load options:

```csharp
csharp
string documentPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "YourPresentation.pptx");
string outputFileName = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
var loadOptions = new PresentationLoadOptions();
```

### Step 2: Create a Watermark
Create a text watermark with desired properties like font, size, alignment, rotation angle, and scale:

```csharp
TextWatermark watermark = new TextWatermark("Protected image", new Font("Arial", 8))
{
    HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Center,
    VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Center,
    RotateAngle = 45,
    SizingType = SizingType.ScaleToParentDimensions,
    ScaleFactor = 1
};
```

### Step 3: Access Images and Add Watermarks
Access the images within the first slide of your presentation, then iterate over them to apply the watermark:

```csharp
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    PresentationContent content = watermarker.GetContent<PresentationContent>();
    WatermarkableImageCollection images = content.Slides[0].FindImages();
    
    foreach (WatermarkableImage image in images)
    {
        image.Add(watermark);
    }
    
    // Save the watermarked presentation
    watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
}
```

### Explanation:
- **`TextWatermark`:** Defines the watermark's text and appearance.
- **`PresentationContent`:** Provides access to slide content.
- **`FindImages()`:** Retrieves all images from a specific slide.

## Practical Applications

1. **Brand Protection:** Embed your company logo or slogan into presentations for brand reinforcement.
2. **Intellectual Property:** Protect proprietary information in shared presentations.
3. **Event Security:** Watermark slides with event details to prevent unauthorized distribution.
4. **Educational Use:** Prevent students from sharing slides without permission.
5. **Corporate Training:** Secure training materials distributed within organizations.

## Performance Considerations

To ensure your application performs efficiently:
- **Optimize Resource Usage:** Manage memory effectively by disposing of resources properly after processing.
- **Scale Appropriately:** Adjust watermark properties like scale factor to balance visibility and performance.
- **Batch Processing:** If dealing with multiple presentations, consider batching operations to streamline processing.
