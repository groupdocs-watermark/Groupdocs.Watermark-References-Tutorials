## Implementation Guide

### Adding a Text Watermark to a Specific Slide

#### Overview

This feature lets you add custom text as a watermark to the first slide of your PowerPoint presentation, ideal for branding or marking confidential documents.

#### Step-by-Step Guide

**1. Initialize Watermarker**
Create an instance of `Watermarker` with your input file path:
```csharp
string documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\InPresentationPptx.pptx";
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath))
{
    // Proceed to the next steps.
}
```

**2. Create and Configure Text Watermark**
Set up your text watermark with desired fonts and properties:
```csharp
TextWatermark textWatermark = new TextWatermark("Test watermark", new Font("Arial", 8));
// Customize the font as needed.
```

**3. Define Slide-Specific Options**
To apply the watermark to only the first slide, configure `PresentationWatermarkSlideOptions`:
```csharp
PresentationWatermarkSlideOptions textWatermarkOptions = new PresentationWatermarkSlideOptions();
textWatermarkOptions.SlideIndex = 0; // Targeting the first slide.
```

**4. Add Watermark and Save**
Finally, add the watermark to your presentation and save it:
```csharp
watermarker.Add(textWatermark, textWatermarkOptions);
string outputFileName = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure the file path is correct and accessible.
- Check font availability if using a custom typeface.

### Adding an Image Watermark to a Specific Slide

#### Overview

This feature allows embedding an image as a watermark on the second slide, perfect for adding logos or other discreet images.

#### Step-by-Step Guide

**1. Initialize Watermarker**
Start by setting up your `Watermarker` instance:
```csharp
string documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\InPresentationPptx.pptx";
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath))
{
    // Continue to the next steps.
}
```

**2. Load and Configure Image Watermark**
Load your watermark image and set properties:
```csharp
using (ImageWatermark imageWatermark = new ImageWatermark("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\LogoJpg.jpg"))
{
    // Adjust size or other settings as needed.
}
```

**3. Define Slide-Specific Options**
Apply the watermark to only the second slide using `PresentationWatermarkSlideOptions`:
```csharp
PresentationWatermarkSlideOptions imageWatermarkOptions = new PresentationWatermarkSlideOptions();
imageWatermarkOptions.SlideIndex = 1; // Targeting the second slide.
```

**4. Add Watermark and Save**
Add the watermark to your presentation and save it:
```csharp
watermarker.Add(imageWatermark, imageWatermarkOptions);
string outputFileName = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Verify the image path is correct.
- Ensure the image file format is supported.
