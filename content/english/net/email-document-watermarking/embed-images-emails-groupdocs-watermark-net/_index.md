## Implementation Guide

### Embedding Images into Email Message Body
This feature allows you to embed images directly within the HTML body of an email message. Here's how you can implement it:

#### Step 1: Define Paths and Load Options
Start by defining your input and output paths for the email document:
```csharp
string documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\InMessageMsg.msg";
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
```
Initialize load options to open your email file:
```csharp
var loadOptions = new EmailLoadOptions();
```

#### Step 2: Open and Retrieve Email Content
Open the email document using a `Watermarker` instance:
```csharp
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // Retrieve the content of the email
    EmailContent content = watermarker.GetContent<EmailContent>();
```

#### Step 3: Read and Add Embedded Image
Read image data from a file and add it to the email content:
```csharp
byte[] imageData = File.ReadAllBytes("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\SampleJpg.jpg");
string fileName = "sample.jpg";
content.EmbeddedObjects.Add(imageData, fileName);
```

#### Step 4: Embed Image in HTML Body
Access the last added embedded object and use its Content ID to embed it into the email body:
```csharp
EmailEmbeddedObject embeddedObject = content.EmbeddedObjects[content.EmbeddedObjects.Count - 1];
string htmlBody = $"<html><body>This is an embedded image: <img src=\"cid:{embeddedObject.ContentId}\"></body></html>";
content.HtmlBody = htmlBody;
```

#### Step 5: Save Modified Email
Finally, save the modified email to a new file:
```csharp
string outputFileName = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
wartermarker.Save(outputFileName);
}
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure your image paths are correct and accessible.
- Verify that the `ContentId` is correctly utilized in the HTML body.

## Practical Applications
Embedding images into email messages can be beneficial for:
1. **Marketing Campaigns:** Enhance newsletters with branded visuals.
2. **Automated Reports:** Include charts or graphs directly within reports sent via email.
3. **Customer Support:** Attach screenshots or diagrams to support emails for better understanding.
4. **Event Invitations:** Add logos and images to make invitations more appealing.
5. **Internal Communications:** Embed organizational charts or infographics.
