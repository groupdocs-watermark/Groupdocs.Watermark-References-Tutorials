### Basic Initialization and Setup

To initialize GroupDocs.Watermark in your project:
```csharp

```
This sets up your environment to utilize the watermarking features provided by GroupDocs.

## Implementation Guide

Let's break down adding watermarks into steps, focusing on applying a text watermark to email attachments.

### Step 1: Prepare Paths for Input and Output

Define paths for your input message file and output directory:
```csharp
string documentPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "InMessage.msg");
string outputDirectory = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
string outputFileName = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
```

### Step 2: Initialize the Watermarker

Load your email file using `EmailLoadOptions`:
```csharp
var loadOptions = new EmailLoadOptions();
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // Further processing will go here.
}
```

### Step 3: Create a Text Watermark

Define your text watermark with the desired font and size:
```csharp
TextWatermark watermark = new TextWatermark("Confidential", new Font("Arial", 19));
```

### Step 4: Access Email Attachments

Retrieve email content to interact with attachments:
```csharp
EmailContent content = watermarker.GetContent<EmailContent>();
foreach (EmailAttachment attachment in content.Attachments)
{
    // Check if the attachment is supported and not encrypted.
    IDocumentInfo info = attachment.GetDocumentInfo();
    if (info.FileType != FileType.Unknown && !info.IsEncrypted)
    {
        using (Watermarker attachedWatermarker = attachment.CreateWatermarker())
        {
            attachedWatermarker.Add(watermark);
            attachedWatermarker.Save();
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 5: Save the Watermarked Email

Save your email with watermarked attachments:
```csharp
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Unsupported File Types:** Ensure that attachment file types are supported by checking `FileType`.
- **Encryption Issues:** Verify that attachments are not encrypted to prevent errors.

## Practical Applications

Watermarking email attachments is useful in various scenarios:
1. **Legal Documents:** Add confidentiality notices to legal contracts shared via email.
2. **Branding:** Ensure your company logo appears on all distributed documents.
3. **Internal Communication:** Watermark drafts or internal memos for tracking purposes.
4. **Educational Materials:** Mark student submissions with their names before sharing feedback.

## Performance Considerations

When implementing watermarks, consider the following:
- **Batch Processing:** Process multiple emails in batches to reduce overhead.
- **Resource Management:** Use `using` statements to manage resources efficiently and avoid memory leaks.
- **Selective Watermarking:** Apply watermarks only to necessary attachments to save processing time.
