## Implementation Guide
This section will guide you through removing specific DOCX attachments from an email using GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET.

### Removing Specific Attachments from an Email

#### Overview
Learn how to remove attachments with a particular name and file type (DOCX) from an email. This feature helps declutter emails by eliminating unnecessary DOCX files programmatically.

#### Step 1: Define Input and Output Paths
Set up paths for your input email file and output directory:

```csharp
string documentPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "InMessage.msg"); // Replace with your actual file name.
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"; // Ensure this directory exists or create it before running the code.
string outputFileName = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
```

#### Step 2: Initialize Email Load Options
Load your email using GroupDocs.Watermark's `Watermarker` class with specific load options:

```csharp
var loadOptions = new EmailLoadOptions();
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // Further processing will be done here.
}
```

#### Step 3: Retrieve and Iterate Over Attachments
Access the email's attachments and iterate over them in reverse order to safely remove items:

```csharp
EmailContent content = watermarker.GetContent<EmailContent>();

for (int i = content.Attachments.Count - 1; i >= 0; i--)
{
    EmailAttachment attachment = content.Attachments[i];
    
    // Check if the attachment name contains 'sample' and is of DOCX file type
    if (attachment.Name.Contains("sample") && attachment.GetDocumentInfo().FileType == FileType.DOCX)
    {
        // Remove the attachment from the email
        content.Attachments.RemoveAt(i);
    }
}
```

#### Step 4: Save the Modified Email
Save the modified email to your specified output path:

```csharp
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure that `YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY` and `YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` paths are correctly set.
- Verify file types of attachments before attempting to remove them to avoid runtime errors.

## Practical Applications
Removing specific attachments from emails is beneficial in various scenarios:
1. **Automated Email Management:** Streamline email processing workflows by programmatically filtering out unwanted DOCX files.
2. **Data Privacy Compliance:** Remove sensitive documents that should not be shared or stored.
3. **Email Archiving:** Simplify the archiving process by excluding large attachments.

These use cases can also integrate with other systems like CRM software to enhance data management processes.

## Performance Considerations
When working with email attachments using GroupDocs.Watermark, consider these tips:
- Optimize memory usage by disposing of objects promptly.
- Process emails in batches if dealing with high volumes to prevent excessive resource consumption.
- Regularly update your .NET environment and dependencies for better efficiency.
