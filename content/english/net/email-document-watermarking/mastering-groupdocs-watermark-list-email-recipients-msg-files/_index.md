using GroupDocs.Watermark.Contents.Email;

// Define the path to your email file.
string documentPath = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\InMessage.msg";

var loadOptions = new EmailLoadOptions();
```

## Implementation Guide

Let's break down how to list all recipients of an email message.

### Listing Direct Recipients

**Overview**

Listing direct recipients helps understand the communication flow effectively.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Initialize Watermarker**: Load your MSG file using `Watermarker`.
2. **Retrieve Email Content**: Access the email content via `GetContent<EmailContent>()`.

```csharp
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // Retrieve the email content.
    EmailContent content = watermarker.GetContent<EmailContent>();

    // Loop through direct recipients and output their addresses.
    foreach (EmailAddress address in content.To)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(address.Address);
    }
}
```

- **Parameters & Return Values**: `Watermarker` takes a file path and load options. The method `GetContent<EmailContent>()` retrieves the message details.

### Listing CC Recipients

**Overview**

Identifying CC recipients helps in tracking email threads effectively.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Iterate Over CC Field**: Use a loop to access each CC recipient's address.

```csharp
foreach (EmailAddress address in content.Cc)
{
    Console.WriteLine(address.Address);
}
```

### Listing BCC Recipients

**Overview**

BCC recipients are often hidden from other email participants, making this step essential for full transparency.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Iterate Over BCC Field**: Similarly loop through the BCC field to reveal all hidden addresses.

```csharp
foreach (EmailAddress address in content.Bcc)
{
    Console.WriteLine(address.Address);
}
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

2. **Communication Analysis**: Understand communication patterns within an organization by analyzing recipient data.
3. **Integration with CRM Systems**: Integrate this feature into Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tools to manage leads and customer communications.

## Performance Considerations

For optimal performance:

- Minimize resource-intensive operations inside loops.
- Ensure efficient memory management when handling large email files.
- Utilize asynchronous methods where possible for non-blocking operations.
