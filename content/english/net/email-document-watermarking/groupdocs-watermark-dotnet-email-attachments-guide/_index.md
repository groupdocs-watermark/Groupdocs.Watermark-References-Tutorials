### Adding Attachments to Emails
This feature allows you to programmatically attach files to existing emails. Follow the instructions below:

string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
var loadOptions = new EmailLoadOptions();
```

#### 2. Initialize Watermarker and Access Email Content
Create a `Watermarker` instance to manage your email file.

using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // Obtain the content of the email
