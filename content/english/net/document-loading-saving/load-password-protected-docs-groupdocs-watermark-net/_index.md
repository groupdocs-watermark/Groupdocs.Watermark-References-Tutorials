## Implementation Guide

### Loading Password-Protected Documents
This feature allows you to load documents that are encrypted with a password, enabling further manipulation and watermarking.

#### Step 1: Configure Document Path and Output Directory
Begin by specifying the paths for your input document and where the output should be saved:

```csharp
string documentPath = "/path/to/your/document/ProtectedDocument.docx";
string outputFileName = Path.Combine("/path/to/output/directory", "ProcessedDocument.docx");
```

#### Step 2: Initialize Watermark Options
Set up the necessary options to handle password-protected documents. This involves specifying the password required to unlock the document:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options;

LoadOptions loadOptions = new LoadOptions();
loadOptions.Password = "yourDocumentPassword";
```

#### Step 3: Load and Process the Document
With your paths configured, you can now load the encrypted document using GroupDocs.Watermark:

```csharp
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // Add a watermark or perform other actions here
}
```

### Key Configuration Options
- **Password**: Essential for accessing encrypted documents.
- **LoadOptions**: Allows customization of how files are loaded.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Common Issue**: Incorrect password results in an exception. Double-check the password accuracy.
- **File Not Found**: Verify that your document path is correct and accessible by your application's permissions.

## Practical Applications

### Real-World Use Cases
1. **Secure Document Management**: Automatically watermark sensitive files upon access to prevent unauthorized distribution.
2. **Automated Archiving**: Load and archive encrypted documents while ensuring they remain protected throughout the process.
3. **Batch Processing Systems**: Integrate into systems that handle bulk document processing, adding watermarks as a form of traceability.

### Integration Possibilities
- Combine with other GroupDocs libraries for comprehensive document management solutions.
