## Import Namespaces
Before you begin watermarking your documents, make sure to import the necessary namespaces to access GroupDocs.Watermark's functionality seamlessly.
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Common;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Contents.Pdf;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options.Pdf;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Watermarks;
using System.IO;
using System;
```

Now that you have everything set up, let's dive into rasterizing a PDF document using GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET. Rasterization converts each page of the PDF document into a raster image format, such as PNG.
## Step 1: Initialize Variables
```csharp
string documentPath = "Your Document Path";
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFileName = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
```
Ensure you replace "Your Document Path" and "Your Document Directory" with the actual path to your PDF document and the desired output directory, respectively.
## Step 2: Load Document and Add Watermark
```csharp
var loadOptions = new PdfLoadOptions();
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // Initialize image or text watermark
    TextWatermark watermark = new TextWatermark("Do not copy", new Font("Arial", 8));
    watermark.HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Center;
    watermark.VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Center;
    watermark.RotateAngle = 45;
    watermark.SizingType = SizingType.ScaleToParentDimensions;
    watermark.ScaleFactor = 1;
    watermark.Opacity = 0.5;
    // Add watermark of any type first
    watermarker.Add(watermark);
    PdfContent pdfContent = watermarker.GetContent<PdfContent>();
    // Rasterize all pages
    pdfContent.Rasterize(100, 100, PdfImageConversionFormat.Png);
    // Content of all pages is replaced with raster images
    watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
}
```
In this step, we load the PDF document and initialize a text watermark with specified properties such as text, font, alignment, rotation angle, sizing type, scale factor, and opacity. Then, we add the watermark to the document. Next, we retrieve the content of the PDF document and rasterize all pages to PNG format with a resolution of 100 DPI. Finally, we save the modified document with rasterized content.
