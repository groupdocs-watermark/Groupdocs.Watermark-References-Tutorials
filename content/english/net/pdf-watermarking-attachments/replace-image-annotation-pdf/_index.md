# Replace Image for Specific Annotation in PDF

## Introduction
Welcome to this comprehensive guide on using GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET to replace images within specific annotations in PDF documents. Whether you're a developer looking to enhance your PDF handling capabilities or simply curious about the intricacies of watermarking, this tutorial has got you covered. By the end, you'll be able to seamlessly replace images in PDF annotations with custom ones, optimizing your document processing workflows.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Basic Understanding of C# and .NET: Familiarity with C# programming and .NET framework.
- GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET: Installed and tutorialsd in your project.
- Development Environment: Visual Studio or any other C# development environment.
- PDF Document: The PDF file you want to modify.
- Image File: The image file you want to use for replacing existing images in annotations.
To get started, make sure you have GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET installed. If not, you can [download it here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/Watermark/net/).
## Import Namespaces
Before writing any code, you need to import the necessary namespaces. This will ensure that you have access to all the classes and methods required for watermarking.
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Contents.Pdf;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options.Pdf;
```
Let's break down the process into manageable steps. Each step will guide you through a specific part of the task, ensuring clarity and ease of understanding.
## Step 1: Load the PDF Document
The first step is to load the PDF document you want to modify. This is done using the `Watermarker` class and `PdfLoadOptions`.

```csharp
string documentPath = "Your Document Path";
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFileName = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
var loadOptions = new PdfLoadOptions();
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // PDF content loading logic will go here.
}
```
In this step, we define the path to the PDF document and specify the output directory where the modified document will be saved. The `PdfLoadOptions` class is used to load the PDF with the appropriate settings.
## Step 2: Access PDF Content
Next, we need to access the content of the PDF document. This will allow us to navigate through the pages and annotations.

```csharp
PdfContent pdfContent = watermarker.GetContent<PdfContent>();
```
By calling `GetContent<PdfContent>()`, we retrieve the content of the PDF, enabling us to work with pages, annotations, and other elements.
## Step 3: Locate Annotations with Images
In this step, we iterate through the annotations in the PDF to find those that contain images.

```csharp
foreach (PdfAnnotation annotation in pdfContent.Pages[0].Annotations)
{
    if (annotation.Image != null)
    {
        // Image replacement logic will go here.
    }
}
```
Here, we loop through the annotations on the first page of the PDF (adjust the index as needed for other pages). We check if an annotation contains an image.
## Step 4: Replace Annotation Images
Once we've identified the annotations with images, we replace them with the desired image.

```csharp
if (annotation.Image != null)
{
    annotation.Image = new PdfWatermarkableImage(File.ReadAllBytes("Path to Your Image File"));
}
```
By creating a new `PdfWatermarkableImage` from the desired image file, we can replace the existing image in the annotation.
## Step 5: Save the Modified Document
Finally, save the modified PDF document to the specified output directory.

```csharp
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```
This step ensures that all changes are saved, and the modified document is ready for use.
