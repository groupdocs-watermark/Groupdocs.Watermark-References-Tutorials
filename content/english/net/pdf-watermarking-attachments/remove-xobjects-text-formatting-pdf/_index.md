# Remove XObjects with Specific Text Formatting in PDF

## Introduction
Watermarking documents is a crucial part of ensuring their authenticity and protecting sensitive information. GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET provides a comprehensive solution for adding, modifying, and removing watermarks from various document formats. In this tutorial, we'll delve into how you can remove XObjects with specific text formatting from PDF documents using GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the code, let's ensure you have everything you need to follow along:
1. Development Environment: Ensure you have a development environment set up with .NET Framework. Visual Studio is a great choice.
2. GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET: Download and install GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET. You can get it from the [download link](https://releases.groupdocs.com/Watermark/net/).
3. License: For full functionality, obtain a [temporary license](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/) or consider purchasing a [license](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy).
4. Sample PDF Document: Have a sample PDF document ready that contains XObjects with specific text formatting (e.g., text fragments in red color).

## Import Namespaces
To get started, ensure you import the necessary namespaces in your project. Here’s the list of namespaces you’ll need:
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Contents.Pdf;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options.Pdf;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Search;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Watermarks;
using System.IO;
using System;
```
## Step 1: Set Up Your Project
Before you write any code, set up your project in Visual Studio or your preferred .NET development environment.
1. Create a New Project: Start by creating a new Console Application project in Visual Studio.
2. Add References: Add tutorialss to the GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET library.
## Step 2: Define Paths
Next, define the paths for your input and output files. This ensures that your code knows where to look for the PDF document and where to save the modified document.
```csharp
string documentPath = "Your Document Path";
string outputDirectory = "Your Output Directory";
string outputFileName = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
```
Replace `"Your Document Path"` and `"Your Output Directory"` with the actual paths on your system.
## Step 3: Load the PDF Document
Now, let's load the PDF document using GroupDocs.Watermark. This is done with the help of `PdfLoadOptions` and the `Watermarker` class.
```csharp
var loadOptions = new PdfLoadOptions();
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
```
The `using` statement ensures that the `Watermarker` object is properly disposed of once we're done with it.
## Step 4: Access PDF Content
To manipulate the PDF content, we need to get the `PdfContent` object from the `Watermarker`.
```csharp
PdfContent pdfContent = watermarker.GetContent<PdfContent>();
```
This allows us to access the pages and the elements within each page of the PDF.
## Step 5: Iterate Through Pages and XObjects
Now, we need to iterate through each page of the PDF and then through each XObject within those pages.
```csharp
foreach (PdfPage page in pdfContent.Pages)
{
    for (int i = page.XObjects.Count - 1; i >= 0; i--)
    {
```
We iterate backward through the `XObjects` to avoid issues when removing items from the collection.
## Step 6: Check Text Formatting and Remove XObjects
For each XObject, we check if it contains text fragments with the specific formatting (e.g., red color). If it does, we remove the XObject from the page.
```csharp
        foreach (FormattedTextFragment fragment in page.XObjects[i].FormattedTextFragments)
        {
            if (fragment.ForegroundColor.Equals(Color.Red))
            {
                page.XObjects.RemoveAt(i);
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
This ensures that only the XObjects with the specified text formatting are removed.
## Step 7: Save the Modified PDF
Finally, save the modified PDF document to the specified output file path.
```csharp
    watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
}
```
This completes the process of removing XObjects with specific text formatting from a PDF document.
