## Introduction
Welcome to our detailed guide on how to replace an image for a specific XObject in a PDF using GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET. If you need to manage watermarks or modify content within your PDF files, you're in the right place. This tutorial will take you through each step, ensuring you can confidently update your PDF documents with new images. Let's dive into it!
## Prerequisites
Before we get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET Library: Download the latest version from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/Watermark/net/).
2. Development Environment: Visual Studio or any other .NET IDE.
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming is required.
4. PDF Document: A PDF document that you want to modify.
5. Image File: The new image file you want to insert into the PDF.

## Import Namespaces
First, we need to import the necessary namespaces in our C# project. This will ensure that we have access to the required classes and methods from the GroupDocs.Watermark library.
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Contents.Pdf;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options.Pdf;
```
## Step 1: Set Up Your Project
To start, ensure your project is set up correctly. Create a new C# project in Visual Studio and install the GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET library. You can install it via NuGet Package Manager by searching for "GroupDocs.Watermark".
```sh
Install-Package GroupDocs.Watermark
```
## Step 2: Define File Paths
Next, define the paths for your input PDF document and the output directory where the modified file will be saved. Also, set the path for the image you want to use as a replacement.
```csharp
string documentPath = "Your Document Path";
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFileName = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
string newImagePath = "Path to Your New Image";
```
## Step 3: Load the PDF Document
Now, we need to load the PDF document using the `PdfLoadOptions` class. This class allows us to specify any options required for loading the PDF.
```csharp
var loadOptions = new PdfLoadOptions();
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    PdfContent pdfContent = watermarker.GetContent<PdfContent>();
```
## Step 4: Replace the Image
We will now loop through the XObjects on the first page of the PDF to find the image we want to replace. Once found, we will replace it with the new image.
```csharp
    // Replace image
    foreach (PdfXObject xObject in pdfContent.Pages[0].XObjects)
    {
        if (xObject.Image != null)
        {
            xObject.Image = new PdfWatermarkableImage(File.ReadAllBytes(newImagePath));
        }
    }
```
## Step 5: Save the Modified Document
Finally, save the modified PDF document to the specified output file.
```csharp
    // Save document
    watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
}
```
