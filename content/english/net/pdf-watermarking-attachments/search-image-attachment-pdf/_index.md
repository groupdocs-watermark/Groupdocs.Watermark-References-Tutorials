## Introduction
GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET is a powerful API designed to facilitate seamless manipulation and management of watermarks in various document formats, including PDFs. Whether you need to add, remove, or search for watermarks within PDF attachments, this versatile tool offers a comprehensive solution.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into using GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
1. .NET Development Environment: Make sure you have a working .NET development environment set up on your machine.
2. GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET Library: Download and install the GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET library from the [download page](https://releases.groupdocs.com/Watermark/net/).
3. Document with PDF Attachments: Prepare a PDF document containing attachments with images for watermark search.
4. Basic Understanding of C# Programming: Familiarize yourself with C# programming language basics to follow along with the examples.

## Import Namespaces
Before using GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET, import the necessary namespaces into your C# code:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Contents.Image;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options.Pdf;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Search.Objects;
```
## Step 1: Load Document and Set Output File
First, specify the path of the document you want to search for watermarks in and define the output file path:
```csharp
string documentPath = "Your Document Path";
string outputFileName = Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
```
## Step 2: Configure Load Options
Initialize load options, especially if your document is a PDF. This step ensures proper handling of PDF attachments:
```csharp
var loadOptions = new PdfLoadOptions();
```
## Step 3: Initialize Watermarker
Create a `Watermarker` object by passing the document path and load options:
```csharp
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // Your code will go here
}
```
## Step 4: Set Searchable Objects
Specify the type of objects to be searched within the document. In this case, we focus on attached images within PDFs:
```csharp
watermarker.SearchableObjects.PdfSearchableObjects = PdfSearchableObjects.AttachedImages;
```
## Step 5: Search for Watermarks
Invoke the `GetImages()` method to search for watermarkable images within the document:
```csharp
WatermarkableImageCollection possibleWatermarks = watermarker.GetImages();
```
## Step 6: Output Results
Finally, display the count of found images:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Found {0} image(s).", possibleWatermarks.Count);
```
