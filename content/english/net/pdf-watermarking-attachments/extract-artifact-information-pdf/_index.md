# Extract Artifact Information from PDF

## Introduction
PDF documents often contain valuable information embedded within various artifacts such as images, text, and shapes. Extracting this information can be crucial for many applications, ranging from data analysis to content management. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to extract artifact information from PDF files using GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET, a powerful .NET library designed specifically for watermarking, searching, and manipulating PDF documents.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET: Download and install GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET library from the [download page](https://releases.groupdocs.com/Watermark/net/).
2. Document Path: Have a PDF document path ready that you want to extract artifact information from.
3. Development Environment: Set up a .NET development environment, such as Visual Studio, with necessary configurations.

## Importing Necessary Namespaces
First, let's import the required namespaces to use GroupDocs.Watermark functionalities in your .NET application:
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Contents.Pdf;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options.Pdf;
using System;
using System.IO;
```
## Step 1: Specify Document Path and Output Directory
```csharp
string documentPath = "Your Document Path";
string outputDirectory = "Your Output Directory";
string outputFileName = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
```
Replace `"Your Document Path"` with the actual path of your PDF document and `"Your Output Directory"` with the directory where you want to save the extracted information.
## Step 2: Load PDF Document and Initialize Watermarker
```csharp
var loadOptions = new PdfLoadOptions();
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // Access PDF content
    PdfContent pdfContent = watermarker.GetContent<PdfContent>();
    // Iterate through each page in the PDF document
    foreach (PdfPage page in pdfContent.Pages)
    {
        // Iterate through artifacts on the current page
        foreach (PdfArtifact artifact in page.Artifacts)
        {
            // Access artifact properties such as type, position, and content
            Console.WriteLine(artifact.ArtifactType);
            Console.WriteLine(artifact.ArtifactSubtype);
            Console.WriteLine(artifact.Text);
            Console.WriteLine(artifact.X);
            Console.WriteLine(artifact.Y);
            Console.WriteLine(artifact.Width);
            Console.WriteLine(artifact.Height);
            // Additional properties like image details can also be accessed if applicable
        }
    }
}
```
