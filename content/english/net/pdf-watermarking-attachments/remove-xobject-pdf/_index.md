## Step 1: Set Up Your Project
### Create a New Project
First, open Visual Studio and create a new Console App (.NET Framework) project. Name it something relevant, like "RemoveXObjectFromPDF".
### Add GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET
Next, add the GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET library to your project. You can do this via NuGet Package Manager:
1. Right-click on your project in Solution Explorer.
2. Select "Manage NuGet Packages".
3. Search for "GroupDocs.Watermark".
4. Install the package.
## Step 2: Load Your PDF Document
### Define Document Path and Output Directory
Specify the path to your PDF document and the directory where you want to save the modified file. This can be done using simple string variables.
```csharp
string documentPath = "Your Document Path";
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFileName = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
```
### Load PDF with PdfLoadOptions
To load the PDF document, you'll need to use `PdfLoadOptions`. This prepares the document for manipulation.
```csharp
var loadOptions = new PdfLoadOptions();
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // Further steps will be nested here
}
```
## Step 3: Access PDF Content
Once the PDF is loaded, you can retrieve its content using the `GetContent` method. This allows you to access various elements of the PDF, including XObjects.
```csharp
PdfContent pdfContent = watermarker.GetContent<PdfContent>();
```
## Step 4: Remove XObjects
### Remove XObject by Index
To remove an XObject by its index, use the `RemoveAt` method. This is useful if you know the exact position of the XObject in the list.
```csharp
pdfContent.Pages[0].XObjects.RemoveAt(0);
```
### Remove XObject by Reference
If you have a tutorials to the specific XObject you want to remove, you can use the `Remove` method. This is particularly handy when dealing with dynamic documents where the index may vary.
```csharp
pdfContent.Pages[0].XObjects.Remove(pdfContent.Pages[0].XObjects[0]);
```
## Step 5: Save the Modified PDF
After making the necessary changes, save the modified PDF to your specified output directory.
```csharp
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```
