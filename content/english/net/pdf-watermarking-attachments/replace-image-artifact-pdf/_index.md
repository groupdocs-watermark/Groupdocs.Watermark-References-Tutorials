# Replace Image for Specific Artifact in PDF

## Introduction
Adding watermarks to documents is an essential practice for ensuring document security, branding, and copyright protection. If you're looking to delve into the world of document watermarking using GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET, you're in the right place. This guide will walk you through the process of replacing images in a PDF document using the GroupDocs.Watermark library. Let's get started!
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- .NET Framework: Make sure you have .NET Framework installed on your machine.
- GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET: Download the latest version of GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET from the [download link](https://releases.groupdocs.com/Watermark/net/).
- Development Environment: An IDE such as Visual Studio.
- Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming is essential.
- Sample PDF Document: Have a sample PDF document ready for testing.
- Test Image: A sample image file that you will use to replace existing images in the PDF.
## Import Namespaces
First, you'll need to import the necessary namespaces to work with GroupDocs.Watermark. This is essential for accessing the library's classes and methods.
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Contents.Pdf;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options.Pdf;
```

## Step 1: Loading the PDF Document
### Define File Paths
Define the path to your PDF document and the directory where the output will be saved. This will help in keeping your code organized and maintainable.
```csharp
string documentPath = "Your Document Path";
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFileName = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
```
### Initialize Load Options
Initialize the `PdfLoadOptions` to load the PDF document. This class provides options to specify how the PDF document should be loaded.
```csharp
var loadOptions = new PdfLoadOptions();
```
## Step 2: Replacing Images in the PDF
### Load the PDF Document
Use the `Watermarker` class to load the PDF document. This class is the entry point for all watermarking operations.
```csharp
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    PdfContent pdfContent = watermarker.GetContent<PdfContent>();
```
### Locate and Replace Images
Loop through the artifacts in the PDF pages to find and replace images. Here, we are targeting the first page and checking if each artifact is an image. If it is, we replace it with the specified image.
```csharp
    foreach (PdfArtifact artifact in pdfContent.Pages[0].Artifacts)
    {
        if (artifact.Image != null)
        {
            artifact.Image = new PdfWatermarkableImage(File.ReadAllBytes("Your Image Path"));
        }
    }
```
### Save the Modified PDF
Finally, save the modified PDF document to the specified output directory. This ensures that your changes are preserved.
```csharp
    watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
}
```
