### 2. Basic Understanding of .NET Framework
Having a fundamental understanding of the .NET Framework will greatly assist you in comprehending the concepts and techniques discussed in this tutorial.
### 3. Familiarity with C# Programming Language
Since GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET is primarily utilized with C# language, it's essential to be familiar with C# programming basics.

## Import Namespaces
To start working with GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET, you need to import the necessary namespaces into your project. This enables you to access the functionalities provided by the library seamlessly.

Removing attachments from PDF documents using GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET involves several steps. Let's break down the process into manageable steps:
## Step 1: Define Document Path and Output Directory
```csharp
string documentPath = "Your Document Path";
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFileName = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
```
In this step, you specify the path of the PDF document from which you want to remove attachments. Also, define the directory where the modified document will be saved.
## Step 2: Load PDF Document with Options
```csharp
var loadOptions = new PdfLoadOptions();
```
Here, you create an instance of `PdfLoadOptions` to specify any additional options for loading the PDF document.
## Step 3: Initialize Watermarker
```csharp
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
```
Initialize the `Watermarker` object by passing the document path and load options. This object provides access to various functionalities for manipulating the document.
## Step 4: Get PDF Content
```csharp
PdfContent pdfContent = watermarker.GetContent<PdfContent>();
```
Retrieve the content of the PDF document using the `GetContent<PdfContent>()` method. This allows you to access attachments and other elements within the PDF.
## Step 5: Iterate Through Attachments and Remove
```csharp
for (int i = pdfContent.Attachments.Count - 1; i >= 0; i--)
{
    PdfAttachment attachment = pdfContent.Attachments[i];
    if (attachment.Name.Contains("sample") && attachment.GetDocumentInfo().FileType == FileType.DOCX)
    {
        pdfContent.Attachments.RemoveAt(i);
    }
}
```
Iterate through the attachments of the PDF document. If a particular condition is met (e.g., attachment name contains "sample" and file type is DOCX), remove the attachment from the document.
## Step 6: Save Modified Document
```csharp
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```
Finally, save the modified PDF document to the specified output directory with the desired file name.
