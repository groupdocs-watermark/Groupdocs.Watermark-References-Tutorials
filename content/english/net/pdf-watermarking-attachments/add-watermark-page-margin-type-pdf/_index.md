## Introduction
In today's digital age, securing documents is more crucial than ever. One way to ensure the integrity and authenticity of your documents is by adding watermarks. Groupdocs.Watermark for .NET is an exceptional tool designed to make this process effortless. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the steps to add a watermark with page margin type in a PDF using Groupdocs.Watermark for .NET.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Groupdocs.Watermark for .NET: Download and install the [latest version](https://releases.groupdocs.com/Watermark/net/) of Groupdocs.Watermark for .NET.
- Development Environment: A .NET development environment like Visual Studio.
- Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming language.
- PDF Document: A PDF document to which you want to add a watermark.
## Import Namespaces
First, you need to import the necessary namespaces in your C# project. These namespaces will provide access to the Groupdocs.Watermark functionalities.
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Common;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Contents.Pdf;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options.Pdf;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Watermarks;
using System.IO;
using System;
```
Now, let's break down the process into manageable steps. Follow each step carefully to add a watermark to your PDF document.
## Step 1: Set Up Your Document Path and Output Directory
First, you'll need to specify the path to your document and the output directory where the watermarked PDF will be saved.
```csharp
string documentPath = "Your Document Path";
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFileName = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
```
## Step 2: Load Your PDF Document
Next, you'll load your PDF document using the `PdfLoadOptions` class. This class allows you to specify any options needed for loading your PDF.
```csharp
var loadOptions = new PdfLoadOptions();
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
```
## Step 3: Create the Text Watermark
Now, it's time to create the watermark. In this example, we'll create a text watermark with specific properties such as font, size, and alignment.
```csharp
TextWatermark watermark = new TextWatermark("Test watermark", new Font("Arial", 42));
watermark.HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Right;
watermark.VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Top;
watermark.SizingType = SizingType.ScaleToParentDimensions;
watermark.ScaleFactor = 1;
```
## Step 4: Set Page Margin Type
To position your watermark appropriately, you'll need to set the page margin type. Here, we set the page margin type to `BleedBox`.
```csharp
PdfContent pdfContent = watermarker.GetContent<PdfContent>();
pdfContent.PageMarginType = PdfPageMarginType.BleedBox;
watermark.ConsiderParentMargins = true;
```
## Step 5: Add and Save the Watermark
Finally, add the watermark to your document and save the modified PDF to the specified output directory.
```csharp
watermarker.Add(watermark);
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
}
```
## Conclusion
And there you have it! By following these steps, you can easily add a watermark with a specific page margin type to your PDF documents using Groupdocs.Watermark for .NET. This not only helps in protecting your documents but also ensures their authenticity. Whether you're dealing with confidential reports, legal documents, or creative works, watermarking is a simple yet effective way to safeguard your content.
