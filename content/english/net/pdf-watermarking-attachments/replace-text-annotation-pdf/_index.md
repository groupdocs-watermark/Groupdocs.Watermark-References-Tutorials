## Introduction
Hey there! Are you looking to seamlessly manage watermarks in your PDF documents using .NET? Look no further! This tutorial will guide you through replacing text for specific annotations in a PDF using Groupdocs.Watermark for .NET. We’ll break down the process into easy-to-follow steps, ensuring you grasp each concept clearly. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a newbie, this guide is tailored to make your experience smooth and productive.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive in, let’s ensure you have everything you need:
1. Development Environment: Visual Studio installed on your machine.
2. Groupdocs.Watermark for .NET: Download and install the latest version from the [download page](https://releases.groupdocs.com/Watermark/net/).
3. .NET Framework: Ensure you have .NET Framework 4.0 or higher.
4. PDF Document: A sample PDF file you can work with.
## Import Namespaces
First things first, you need to import the necessary namespaces. These namespaces provide the classes and methods required for watermark management.
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Contents.Pdf;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options.Pdf;
using System.IO;
using System;
```
## Step 1: Set Up Your Project
### Initialize Your Project
To begin, fire up Visual Studio and create a new Console App project. Name it something memorable, like `WatermarkReplacement`.
### Install Groupdocs.Watermark
Next, you’ll need to install Groupdocs.Watermark. You can do this via the NuGet Package Manager. Simply search for `Groupdocs.Watermark` and install it. Alternatively, you can use the Package Manager Console:
```shell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Watermark
```
## Step 2: Load Your PDF Document
### Define Document Path
Let’s define the path to your PDF document. Make sure your document is accessible from your project directory.
```csharp
string documentPath = "Your Document Path";
string outputFileName = Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
```
### Load the PDF Document
Now, use the `PdfLoadOptions` to load your PDF document.
```csharp
var loadOptions = new PdfLoadOptions();
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // Your code will go here
}
```
## Step 3: Access PDF Annotations
### Retrieve PDF Content
To manipulate the PDF, you need to get its content. The `GetContent<T>()` method helps in fetching the content of the PDF.
```csharp
PdfContent pdfContent = watermarker.GetContent<PdfContent>();
```
### Iterate Through Annotations
Annotations in PDFs can be text, links, or other types of notes. To replace text in specific annotations, you’ll iterate through these annotations.
```csharp
foreach (PdfAnnotation annotation in pdfContent.Pages[0].Annotations)
{
    // Annotation processing will go here
}
```
## Step 4: Replace Annotation Text
### Identify Target Annotations
In this example, we’re looking for annotations containing the text "Test". You’ll use a simple condition to find these annotations.
```csharp
if (annotation.Text.Contains("Test"))
{
    annotation.Text = "Passed";
}
```
### Save the Modified PDF
Finally, save the changes to a new PDF file. This ensures your original document remains unchanged, and you have a new version with the updated annotations.
```csharp
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```
