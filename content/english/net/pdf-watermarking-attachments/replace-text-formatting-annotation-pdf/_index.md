# Replace Text with Formatting for Annotation in PDF

## Introduction
In today's digital age, protecting sensitive information and intellectual property is paramount. Whether you're a legal professional, a corporate entity, or an individual managing crucial documents, safeguarding against unauthorized access and distribution is a must. GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET emerges as a powerful tool in this realm, offering comprehensive functionalities to add, search, and remove watermarks from various document formats such as PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and images. In this tutorial, we'll delve into the intricacies of replacing text with formatting for annotation in PDF files using GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET.
## Prerequisites
Before we embark on this journey, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
### 1. Installation of GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET
Before proceeding, make sure you have installed GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET on your development environment. You can download the latest version from the [website](https://releases.groupdocs.com/Watermark/net/).
### 2. Basic Knowledge of C# Programming
A fundamental understanding of C# programming language is essential to follow along with the examples provided in this tutorial.
### 3. Access to PDF Document
Prepare a PDF document on which you want to perform text replacement with formatting for annotations.

## Import Namespaces
To begin, let's import the necessary namespaces into our C# code:
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Contents.Pdf;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options.Pdf;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Watermarks;
using System.IO;
using System;
```
## Step 1: Load the PDF Document
The first step involves loading the PDF document onto which you want to apply text replacement with formatting for annotations.
```csharp
string documentPath = "Your Document Path";
string outputFileName = Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
var loadOptions = new PdfLoadOptions();
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // Code continues...
}
```
## Step 2: Access PDF Content
Once the document is loaded, we need to access its content to perform operations on annotations.
```csharp
PdfContent pdfContent = watermarker.GetContent<PdfContent>();
```
## Step 3: Iterate Through Annotations
Now, iterate through the annotations present in the first page of the PDF document.
```csharp
foreach (PdfAnnotation annotation in pdfContent.Pages[0].Annotations)
{
    // Code continues...
}
```
## Step 4: Replace Text with Formatting
Within the iteration, check if the annotation contains the specified text to be replaced.
```csharp
if (annotation.Text.Contains("Test"))
{
    // Code continues...
}
```
## Step 5: Apply Replacement Formatting
If the text is found, clear the existing text fragments and add formatted text as a replacement.
```csharp
annotation.FormattedTextFragments.Clear();
annotation.FormattedTextFragments.Add("Passed", new Font("Calibri", 19, FontStyle.Bold), Color.Red, Color.Aqua);
```
## Step 6: Save the Document
Finally, save the modified document with the applied changes.
```csharp
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```
