## Introduction
Do you often find yourself needing to extract detailed annotation information from your PDF documents? Whether you're a developer working on document management systems or a business professional handling numerous PDFs, efficiently extracting and processing annotations can be crucial. With GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET, you have a powerful toolkit at your disposal to make this task straightforward and efficient.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the code, let's ensure you have everything you need to get started:
1. Visual Studio: Make sure you have Visual Studio installed. This will be our IDE for writing and running the code.
2. GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET: You need to have the GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET library. You can [download it here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/Watermark/net/).
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming is necessary to follow along with the examples.
## Import Namespaces
To begin with, you need to import the necessary namespaces into your project. These namespaces contain the classes and methods required to work with PDF files and extract annotations.
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Contents.Pdf;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options.Pdf;
using System;
using System.IO;
```
## Step 1: Set Up Your Project
First, let's set up our project in Visual Studio. Create a new Console App (.NET Core) project. Once your project is created, you need to add a tutorials to the GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET library.
1. Open the NuGet Package Manager.
2. Search for `GroupDocs.Watermark`.
3. Install the `GroupDocs.Watermark` package.
## Step 2: Define Document Paths
Next, you'll need to specify the paths for your input PDF document and the output directory where the extracted information will be saved. This ensures that your application knows where to find the PDF file and where to store the results.
```csharp
string documentPath = "Your Document Path";
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFileName = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
```
## Step 3: Load the PDF Document
To work with the PDF document, we need to load it using `PdfLoadOptions`. This class provides options to configure the loading process.
```csharp
var loadOptions = new PdfLoadOptions();
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // Code to extract annotations will go here
}
```
## Step 4: Access PDF Content
Once the document is loaded, we can access its content. Specifically, we want to get the PDF content so we can iterate through the pages and annotations.
```csharp
PdfContent pdfContent = watermarker.GetContent<PdfContent>();
```
## Step 5: Iterate Through Pages and Annotations
With the PDF content in hand, we can loop through each page and then through each annotation on those pages. This allows us to extract the information we need.
```csharp
foreach (PdfPage page in pdfContent.Pages)
{
    foreach (PdfAnnotation annotation in page.Annotations)
    {
        // Extract annotation details here
    }
}
```
## Step 6: Extract Annotation Details
Within the nested loops, we extract various details about each annotation. This includes the type of annotation, any associated images, text, and positional data.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine(annotation.AnnotationType);
if (annotation.Image != null)
{
    Console.WriteLine(annotation.Image.Width);
    Console.WriteLine(annotation.Image.Height);
    Console.WriteLine(annotation.Image.GetBytes().Length);
}
Console.WriteLine(annotation.Text);
Console.WriteLine(annotation.X);
Console.WriteLine(annotation.Y);
Console.WriteLine(annotation.Width);
Console.WriteLine(annotation.Height);
Console.WriteLine(annotation.RotateAngle);
```
## Step 7: Save or Process Extracted Data
Finally, decide what you want to do with the extracted annotation information. You can print it to the console, save it to a file, or even store it in a database, depending on your needs.
```csharp
// Example of saving the extracted data to a file
using (StreamWriter writer = new StreamWriter(outputFileName))
{
    foreach (PdfPage page in pdfContent.Pages)
    {
        foreach (PdfAnnotation annotation in page.Annotations)
        {
            writer.WriteLine($"Annotation Type: {annotation.AnnotationType}");
            if (annotation.Image != null)
            {
                writer.WriteLine($"Image Width: {annotation.Image.Width}");
                writer.WriteLine($"Image Height: {annotation.Image.Height}");
                writer.WriteLine($"Image Bytes: {annotation.Image.GetBytes().Length}");
            }
            writer.WriteLine($"Text: {annotation.Text}");
            writer.WriteLine($"Position: ({annotation.X}, {annotation.Y})");
            writer.WriteLine($"Size: {annotation.Width}x{annotation.Height}");
            writer.WriteLine($"Rotate Angle: {annotation.RotateAngle}");
        }
    }
}
```
