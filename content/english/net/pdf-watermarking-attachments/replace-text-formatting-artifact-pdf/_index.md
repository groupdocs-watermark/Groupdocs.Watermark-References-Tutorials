# Replace Text with Formatting for Artifact in PDF

## Introduction
In the realm of .NET development, managing artifacts and watermarking documents is often a crucial task. Fortunately, with GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET, developers have a powerful toolkit at their disposal to seamlessly integrate watermarking and artifact management functionalities into their applications. In this comprehensive tutorial, we'll delve into the process of replacing text with formatting for artifacts in PDF documents using GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the tutorial, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:
1. GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET: Download and install the GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET library from the [download link](https://releases.groupdocs.com/Watermark/net/).
2. Development Environment: Have a compatible development environment set up for .NET development.
3. Basic Understanding of C#: Familiarity with C# programming language is essential to follow along with the examples.

## Import Namespaces
To get started, import the necessary namespaces into your C# project:
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Contents.Pdf;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options.Pdf;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Watermarks;
using System.IO;
using System;
```
## Step 1: Load the Document
```csharp
string documentPath = "Your Document Path";
var loadOptions = new PdfLoadOptions();
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // Document processing code will go here
}
```
Ensure to replace `"Your Document Path"` with the path to your PDF document.
## Step 2: Access PDF Content
```csharp
PdfContent pdfContent = watermarker.GetContent<PdfContent>();
```
This step retrieves the content of the PDF document for further processing.
## Step 3: Iterate Through Artifacts
```csharp
foreach (PdfArtifact artifact in pdfContent.Pages[0].Artifacts)
{
    // Artifact processing code will go here
}
```
Here, we loop through the artifacts present on the first page of the PDF document.
## Step 4: Replace Text with Formatting
```csharp
if (artifact.Text.Contains("Test"))
{
    artifact.FormattedTextFragments.Clear();
    artifact.FormattedTextFragments.Add("Passed", new Font("Calibri", 19, FontStyle.Bold), Color.Red, Color.Aqua);
}
```
In this step, we check if the artifact contains the text "Test" and replace it with formatted text.
## Step 5: Save Document
```csharp
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```
Finally, we save the modified PDF document to the specified output file.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we explored how to replace text with formatting for artifacts in PDF documents using GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET. By following the step-by-step guide and leveraging the powerful features of this library, developers can efficiently manage artifacts and watermarking tasks within their .NET applications.
