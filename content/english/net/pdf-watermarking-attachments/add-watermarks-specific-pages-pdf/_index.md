In this tutorial, we'll explore how to use Groupdocs.Watermark for .NET to add both text and image watermarks to specific pages in your PDF files. We'll break down the process into manageable steps, ensuring you can follow along and implement these features in your projects.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the implementation, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Visual Studio Installed: You'll need an IDE like Visual Studio to write and run your .NET code.
- .NET Framework: Ensure you have the .NET framework installed on your machine.
- Groupdocs.Watermark for .NET: Download and install Groupdocs.Watermark for .NET. You can get it [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/Watermark/net/).
- Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming language will be beneficial.
- A PDF Document: Have a PDF file ready that you can use to test adding watermarks.
## Import Namespaces
To start, you'll need to import the necessary namespaces into your project. This step is crucial as it allows you to access the Groupdocs.Watermark classes and methods.
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options.Pdf;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Watermarks;
using System.IO;
using System;
```
## Step 1: Setting Up the Project
### Create a New Project
First, open Visual Studio and create a new C# project. You can choose a Console Application for simplicity.
```plaintext
File -> New -> Project -> Console App (.NET Core)
```
### Install Groupdocs.Watermark
Next, install the Groupdocs.Watermark library via NuGet Package Manager.
```plaintext
Tools -> NuGet Package Manager -> Manage NuGet Packages for Solution
```
Search for "Groupdocs.Watermark" and install it.
## Step 2: Load Your PDF Document
### Define Document Paths
Specify the path to your PDF document and the output directory where the watermarked PDF will be saved.
```csharp
string documentPath = "Your Document Path";
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFileName = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
```
### Load the PDF Document
Use the `PdfLoadOptions` class to load your PDF document.
```csharp
var loadOptions = new PdfLoadOptions();
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // Your code to add watermarks will go here
}
```
## Step 3: Add Text Watermark to Odd Pages
### Create a Text Watermark
Create a `TextWatermark` object with your desired text and font settings.
```csharp
TextWatermark textWatermark = new TextWatermark("This is a test watermark", new Font("Arial", 8));
textWatermark.PagesSetup = new PagesSetup
{
    OddPages = true
};
```
### Apply Text Watermark Options
Use `PdfArtifactWatermarkOptions` to specify how the watermark should be applied.
```csharp
PdfArtifactWatermarkOptions textWatermarkOptions = new PdfArtifactWatermarkOptions();
watermarker.Add(textWatermark, textWatermarkOptions);
```
## Step 4: Add Image Watermark to the First Page
Load an image to use as a watermark. Ensure the image path is correct.
```csharp
using (ImageWatermark imageWatermark = new ImageWatermark("Path to Your Image"))
{
    imageWatermark.PagesSetup = new PagesSetup
    {
        FirstPage = true
    };
    
    PdfArtifactWatermarkOptions imageWatermarkOptions = new PdfArtifactWatermarkOptions();
    watermarker.Add(imageWatermark, imageWatermarkOptions);
}
```
## Step 5: Save the Watermarked PDF
Finally, save your watermarked PDF to the specified output directory.
```csharp
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```
