### 4. Access to Document(s)

## Import Namespaces
Before delving into the step-by-step guide, it's essential to import the required namespaces to utilize the functionalities provided by GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET effectively.
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Contents.Pdf;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options.Pdf;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Search;
using System.IO;
using System;
```
## Step 1: Load the Document
```csharp
string documentPath = "Your Document Path";
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFileName = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
var loadOptions = new PdfLoadOptions();
```
In this step, specify the path to the PDF document you want to process and define the output directory where the modified document will be saved. Additionally, initialize the `PdfLoadOptions` to configure loading options for the PDF document.
## Step 2: Initialize Watermarker
```csharp
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // Processing logic will go here
}
```
Create a `Watermarker` instance by passing the document path and load options. Ensure to encapsulate the watermarker within a `using` statement to automatically dispose of resources after use.
## Step 3: Retrieve PDF Content
```csharp
PdfContent pdfContent = watermarker.GetContent<PdfContent>();
```
Retrieve the content of the PDF document using the `GetContent<PdfContent>()` method of the watermarker instance.
## Step 4: Iterate Through Pages and Artifacts
```csharp
foreach (PdfPage page in pdfContent.Pages)
{
    for (int i = page.Artifacts.Count - 1; i >= 0; i--)
    {
        // Artifact processing logic will go here
    }
}
```
Iterate through each page of the PDF document and examine its artifacts to identify those with specific text formatting.
## Step 5: Remove Artifacts Based on Formatting Criteria
```csharp
foreach (FormattedTextFragment fragment in page.Artifacts[i].FormattedTextFragments)
{
    if (fragment.Font.Size > 42)
    {
        page.Artifacts.RemoveAt(i);
        break;
    }
}
```
Check each formatted text fragment within the artifacts and remove those that meet the specified formatting criteria. In this example, artifacts with text larger than a font size of 42 are removed.
## Step 6: Save the Modified Document
```csharp
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```
Finally, save the modified PDF document to the specified output directory with the desired file name.
