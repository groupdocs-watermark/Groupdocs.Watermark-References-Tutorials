# Replace Text for Specific Artifact in PDF

## Introduction
In today's digital age, protecting the integrity and confidentiality of documents is paramount. Whether you're a legal professional safeguarding sensitive contracts or a business executive ensuring the security of proprietary information, the need for reliable document protection cannot be overstated. GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET emerges as a robust solution, offering seamless integration and powerful functionalities to watermark and manipulate documents effortlessly.
## Prerequisites
Before delving into the intricacies of GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. Installation: Download and install GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET from the [download page](https://releases.groupdocs.com/Watermark/net/).
2. Basic Understanding of C#: Familiarize yourself with C# programming language fundamentals.
3. Development Environment: Have a compatible IDE such as Visual Studio installed on your system.
4. Document to Manipulate: Prepare a sample document (PDF, Word, Excel, etc.) for watermarking and text replacement.

## Import Namespaces
To commence your journey with GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET, you'll need to import the necessary namespaces into your project. Follow these steps:

In the beginning of your C# file, import the required namespaces:
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Contents.Pdf;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options.Pdf;
using System.IO;
using System;
```
## Step 1: Load the Document
```csharp
string documentPath = "Your Document Path";
string outputFileName = Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
var loadOptions = new PdfLoadOptions();
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
```
In this step, we specify the path to the document we want to manipulate and create an output file name for the processed document. We then instantiate a `Watermarker` object and specify the document path along with any load options, in this case, `PdfLoadOptions`.
## Step 2: Access PDF Content
```csharp
PdfContent pdfContent = watermarker.GetContent<PdfContent>();
```
Here, we retrieve the content of the PDF document using the `GetContent` method of the `Watermarker` object, specifying the type of content as `PdfContent`.
## Step 3: Iterate Through Artifacts
```csharp
foreach (PdfArtifact artifact in pdfContent.Pages[0].Artifacts)
{
```
We iterate through the artifacts present on the first page of the PDF document.
## Step 4: Replace Text
```csharp
if (artifact.Text.Contains("Test"))
{
    artifact.Text = "Passed";
}
```
Within the loop, we check if the text of the artifact contains the specified text, in this case, "Test". If it does, we replace it with the desired text, "Passed".
## Step 5: Save the Document
```csharp
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```
Finally, we save the modified document with the specified output file name.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET empowers developers with the tools necessary to manipulate documents with ease and precision. By following the step-by-step guide outlined above, you can efficiently replace text for specific artifacts in PDF documents, ensuring data integrity and security.
