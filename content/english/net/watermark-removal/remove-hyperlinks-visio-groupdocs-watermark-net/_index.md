# Efficiently Remove Hyperlinks from Visio Diagrams Using GroupDocs.Watermark .NET

## Introduction

Need to clean up your Visio diagrams by removing unwanted hyperlinks? Whether it's part of document maintenance or preparing files for distribution, managing hyperlinks can be crucial. This step-by-step guide will show you how to use the powerful GroupDocs.Watermark library in a .NET environment to efficiently remove specific hyperlinks from shapes within your Visio diagrams.

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to integrate GroupDocs.Watermark with your .NET project
- Steps to identify and remove hyperlinks from diagram shapes
- Best practices for setting up and optimizing the GroupDocs library

## Prerequisites
To follow along, ensure you have:
- **Development Environment:** A .NET development environment such as Visual Studio.
- **GroupDocs.Watermark Library:** Install version 21.10 or later of GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET.
- **Visio File:** A `.vsdx` file where hyperlinks need to be removed.

### Required Libraries and Dependencies
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET
- System.IO (for file path operations)

### Environment Setup Requirements
Make sure your development environment is set up with the .NET SDK. The GroupDocs library supports a wide range of .NET frameworks, so compatibility should not be an issue.

### Knowledge Prerequisites
A basic understanding of C# and familiarity with handling files in .NET will help you follow this tutorial effectively.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET
To get started, install the GroupDocs.Watermark library using one of these methods:

**.NET CLI**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Watermark
```

**Package Manager Console**
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Watermark
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI**
Search for "GroupDocs.Watermark" in the NuGet Gallery and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition Steps
To use GroupDocs.Watermark:
- **Free Trial:** Start with a free trial to explore all functionalities.
- **Temporary License:** Obtain a temporary license for extensive testing.
- **Purchase:** For full access, purchase a license from [GroupDocs](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/).

### Basic Initialization and Setup
Once installed, initialize the GroupDocs library in your project. Hereâ€™s how to load a Visio document:
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Contents.Diagram;
using System.IO;

string documentPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "YourDiagram.vsdx");

// Load options for the diagram document.
DiagramLoadOptions loadOptions = new DiagramLoadOptions();
```

## Implementation Guide
Now, let's break down how to remove hyperlinks from a Visio shape.

### Loading Your Visio Document
First, load your Visio file using GroupDocs.Watermark. This step sets up access to the diagram contents:
```csharp
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Contents.Diagram;

string documentPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "YourDiagram.vsdx");
DiagramLoadOptions loadOptions = new DiagramLoadOptions();
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // Access the content of the loaded Visio diagram.
    DiagramContent content = watermarker.GetContent<DiagramContent>();
}
```

### Identifying and Removing Hyperlinks
Once your document is loaded, access its shapes to find and remove hyperlinks. Here's how:
```csharp
// Retrieve the first shape from the first page in the document.
DiagramShape shape = content.Pages[0].Shapes[0];

// Iterate through hyperlinks associated with the shape, removing those that match a specific URL pattern.
for (int i = shape.Hyperlinks.Count - 1; i >= 0; i--)
{
    if (shape.Hyperlinks[i].Address.Contains("http://someurl.com"))
    {
        // Remove hyperlink from the shape.
        shape.Hyperlinks.RemoveAt(i);
    }
}
```
**Explanation:** This loop checks each hyperlink within a specific shape for a given URL pattern. When it finds a match, it removes that hyperlink.

### Saving Your Modified Diagram
After removing unwanted hyperlinks, save your changes:
```csharp
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFileName = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, Path.GetFileName(documentPath));

// Save the modified diagram to a specified output file.
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```
**Troubleshooting Tips:**
- Ensure paths are correctly set for both input and output files.
- Verify that the shape index and page number exist in your document.

## Practical Applications
Removing hyperlinks can be useful in several scenarios, such as:
1. **Document Clean-Up:** Before sharing diagrams with clients or stakeholders, ensure no unnecessary links remain.
2. **Template Creation:** When creating templates for internal use, stripping out external references maintains security and integrity.
3. **Compliance Audits:** Remove all hyperlinks to meet specific compliance requirements.

## Performance Considerations
When working with large Visio files:
- Optimize memory usage by disposing of objects promptly.
- Process documents in batches if applicable.
- Use efficient loops and condition checks to minimize processing time.

**Best Practices:**
- Always dispose of `Watermarker` instances using a `using` statement.
- Manage file streams properly to avoid locks or corruption.

## Conclusion
