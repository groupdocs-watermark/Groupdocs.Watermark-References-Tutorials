### Basic Initialization
Initialize the GroupDocs.Watermark library in your application:
```csharp
string documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\document.docx";
var loadOptions = new WordProcessingLoadOptions();
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // Your code to manipulate shapes here
}
```

## Implementation Guide
### Feature Overview: Removing Shapes with Specific Text Formatting
This feature allows you to remove shapes based on specific text formatting criteria like font family and color.

#### Step 1: Load the Document
Load your Word document using the `Watermarker` class:
```csharp
string documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\document.docx";
var loadOptions = new WordProcessingLoadOptions();
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // Further processing
}
```

#### Step 2: Access Document Content
Retrieve the content to access sections and shapes:
```csharp
WordProcessingContent content = watermarker.GetContent<WordProcessingContent>();
```

#### Step 3: Iterate Through Sections and Shapes
Loop through each section and shape, checking for specific formatting criteria:
```csharp
foreach (WordProcessingSection section in content.Sections)
{
    for (int i = section.Shapes.Count - 1; i >= 0; i--)
    {
        // Check each formatted text fragment within the shape
        foreach (FormattedTextFragment fragment in section.Shapes[i].FormattedTextFragments)
        {
            // Conditional check: Red color and Arial font
            if (fragment.ForegroundColor.Equals(Color.Red) && fragment.Font.FamilyName == "Arial")
            {
                section.Shapes.RemoveAt(i);
                break; // Exit loop once shape is removed
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Step 4: Save the Modified Document
Save your changes to a new document:
```csharp
string outputFileName = Path.Combine(YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure GroupDocs.Watermark is correctly installed and referenced.
- Verify color and font family properties are accurately checked against the shapeâ€™s text fragments.
