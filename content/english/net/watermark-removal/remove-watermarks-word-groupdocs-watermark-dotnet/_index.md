## Implementation Guide

### Feature: Search for Watermarks in Word Headers/Footers
This feature allows you to locate specific text and image watermarks within Word document headers or footers efficiently.

#### Overview of What This Accomplishes
By leveraging GroupDocs.Watermark, we can search and remove unwanted watermarks from your documents, enhancing their presentation quality.

**Steps for Implementation:**

##### Step 1: Define Document Paths
Clearly define the paths to your input and output files:
```csharp
string documentPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "YourDocument.docx");
string outputFileName = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
```

##### Step 2: Initialize Watermarker
Create a `Watermarker` instance to handle your document:
```csharp
var loadOptions = new WordProcessingLoadOptions();
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // Further processing here
}
```

**Why This Matters**: Initializing with `WordProcessingLoadOptions` ensures that the library correctly identifies and processes Word documents.

##### Step 3: Set Up Search Criteria
Define criteria to identify both text and image-based watermarks:
```csharp
ImageSearchCriteria imageSearchCriteria = new ImageDctHashSearchCriteria("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/YourLogo.png");
TextSearchCriteria textSearchCriteria = new TextSearchCriteria("Company Name");
```

**Parameters Explained**: 
- `ImageDctHashSearchCriteria` searches for a specific image watermark.
- `TextSearchCriteria` targets specific text strings.

##### Step 4: Search and Remove Watermarks
Retrieve possible watermarks from the document’s headers and remove them:
```csharp
WordProcessingContent content = watermarker.GetContent<WordProcessingContent>();
PossibleWatermarkCollection possibleWatermarks = content.Sections[0]
                                                        .HeadersFooters[OfficeHeaderFooterType.HeaderPrimary]
                                                        .Search(textSearchCriteria.Or(imageSearchCriteria));

for (int i = possibleWatermarks.Count - 1; i >= 0; i--)
{
    possibleWatermarks.RemoveAt(i);
}
```

**Troubleshooting Tip**: If watermarks aren't found, verify your search criteria and paths.

##### Step 5: Save the Document
Finally, save the document without unwanted watermarks:
```csharp
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```

## Practical Applications
Here are some real-world scenarios where this functionality shines:
1. **Corporate Branding**: Ensure documents conform to branding guidelines by removing outdated logos.
2. **Document Clean-up**: Prepare professional documents free from previous edits or annotations.
3. **Legal Documents**: Maintain document integrity by eliminating irrelevant watermarks.
