## Implementation Guide

With everything set up, let's break down the implementation into manageable steps.

### Removing PDF Attachments with Specific Criteria

#### Overview
In this section, we'll focus on removing attachments from a PDF that match certain criteriaâ€”specifically, those named "sample" and of type DOCX. This is useful for cleaning documents automatically without manual intervention.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
**1. Define Paths**
Set paths to your input PDF and output directory:
```csharp
string documentPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "document.pdf");
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFileName = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
```
**2. Load the Document**
Create load options for reading the PDF file:
```csharp
var loadOptions = new PdfLoadOptions();
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // The rest of your code will go here.
}
```
**3. Access PDF Content**
Retrieve the content as a `PdfContent` object to interact with attachments:
```csharp
PdfContent pdfContent = watermarker.GetContent<PdfContent>();
```
**4. Iterate and Remove Attachments**
Iterate over the attachments in reverse order for safe removal while iterating:
```csharp
for (int i = pdfContent.Attachments.Count - 1; i >= 0; i--)
{
    PdfAttachment attachment = pdfContent.Attachments[i];

    // Check if the attachment name contains "sample" and its file type is DOCX.
    if (attachment.Name.Contains("sample") && attachment.GetDocumentInfo().FileType == FileType.DOCX)
    {
        // Remove the matching attachment from the PDF content.
        pdfContent.Attachments.RemoveAt(i);
    }
}
```
**5. Save the Modified Document**
Save the modified document to your desired output path:
```csharp
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```
### Troubleshooting Tips
- **File Path Errors**: Ensure file paths are correctly set and accessible.
- **Attachment Access Issues**: Verify you have read permissions for the PDF files.

## Practical Applications
Removing attachments from PDFs can be beneficial in various scenarios:
1. **Document Management Systems**: Automate cleanup processes to maintain organized records.
2. **Legal Documentation**: Ensure compliance by removing unnecessary or sensitive attachments.
