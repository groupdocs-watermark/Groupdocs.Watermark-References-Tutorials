## Implementation Guide
We'll break down the feature into logical steps to help you understand each part of the process clearly.

### Removing Unwanted Attachments from Worksheets
**Overview**
This feature allows you to clean up Excel worksheets by removing attachments that are either broken links or encrypted files, ensuring your documents remain organized and free of unnecessary content.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

##### Step 1: Define Paths for Input and Output Files
Start by setting the paths for your input spreadsheet and output file:
```csharp
string documentPath = Path.Combine(@"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "YourSpreadsheet.xlsx");
string outputFileName = Path.Combine(@"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "OutputSpreadsheet.xlsx");
```

##### Step 2: Create Loading Options
Configure loading options to prepare for processing the document:
```csharp
var loadOptions = new SpreadsheetLoadOptions();
```

##### Step 3: Initialize Watermarker
Use the `Watermarker` class to open and manage your document:
```csharp
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // Proceed with further steps here
}
```

##### Step 4: Retrieve Spreadsheet Content
Access the content of the spreadsheet for manipulation:
```csharp
SpreadsheetContent content = watermarker.GetContent<SpreadsheetContent>();
```

##### Step 5: Iterate Through Worksheets
Loop through each worksheet to examine attachments:
```csharp
foreach (SpreadsheetWorksheet worksheet in content.Worksheets)
{
    // Attachment processing logic goes here
}
```

##### Step 6: Check and Remove Attachments Based on Conditions
Identify and remove attachments that meet specific criteria, such as broken links or encryption:
```csharp
for (int i = worksheet.Attachments.Count - 1; i >= 0; i--)
{
    SpreadsheetAttachment attachment = worksheet.Attachments[i];
    
    if ((attachment.IsLink && !File.Exists(attachment.SourceFullName)) ||
        attachment.GetDocumentInfo().IsEncrypted)
    {
        worksheet.Attachments.RemoveAt(i);
    }
}
```

##### Step 7: Save Changes to Output File
Finally, save the cleaned-up document:
```csharp
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```

**Troubleshooting Tips**
- Ensure your paths are correctly set.
- Verify file permissions for reading and writing operations.

## Practical Applications
Here are some real-world use cases where removing attachments from Excel worksheets can be beneficial:
1. **Data Cleanup**: Before archiving financial reports, remove unnecessary attachments to minimize storage usage.
2. **Document Management**: Automate the cleanup of project documentation by eliminating outdated links or encrypted files.
3. **Collaboration Tools Integration**: Integrate this feature with collaborative platforms like SharePoint for streamlined document management.

## Performance Considerations
To optimize performance when using GroupDocs.Watermark:
- Limit processing to necessary worksheets only.
- Manage memory usage effectively by disposing of resources promptly after use.
- Follow best practices for .NET memory management, such as avoiding large object heap allocations.
