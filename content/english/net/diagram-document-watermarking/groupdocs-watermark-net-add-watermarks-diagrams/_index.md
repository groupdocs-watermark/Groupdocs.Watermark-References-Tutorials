- A development environment that supports .NET (e.g., Visual Studio).

### Environment Setup Requirements
Ensure your system is configured to run .NET applications, with basic C# programming skills in file handling and object-oriented programming.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET

To start using GroupDocs.Watermark, install the library in your project through:

### Using .NET CLI
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Watermark
```

### Package Manager Console (NuGet)

```

### NuGet Package Manager UI
Search for "GroupDocs.Watermark" in the NuGet Package Manager and install it.

#### License Acquisition Steps
- **Free Trial**: Test features with a temporary license.
- **Temporary License**: Apply on the GroupDocs website to evaluate full capabilities.

After installation, create a `Watermarker` object to manage watermark operations.

## Implementation Guide

With everything set up, let's add watermarks to diagrams using GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET.

### Adding Watermarks to Diagrams with Separate Background Pages

This feature allows adding text watermarks to diagram background pages. Here’s how:

#### Step 1: Initialize the Watermarker Object
Load your document and initialize a `Watermarker` object.
```csharp
string documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"; // Replace with your file path
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"; // Replace with your output directory path
string outputFileName = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, Path.GetFileName(documentPath));
DiagramLoadOptions loadOptions = new DiagramLoadOptions();
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // Further steps will go here...
}
```

#### Step 2: Create a Text Watermark
Define the watermark text and style.
```csharp
TextWatermark textWatermark = new TextWatermark("Test watermark", new Font("Calibri", 19));
```
Here, "Test watermark" is displayed in Calibri font at size 19 points.

#### Step 3: Configure Watermark Options
Specify where the watermark should be placed on the diagram:
```csharp
DiagramShapeWatermarkOptions options = new DiagramShapeWatermarkOptions();
options.PlacementType = DiagramWatermarkPlacementType.SeparateBackgrounds; // Target separate backgrounds
```

#### Step 4: Add and Save the Watermark
Add your watermark using defined parameters, then save the file.
```csharp
watermarker.Add(textWatermark, options);
watermarker.Save(outputFileName);
```
This step saves the modified file in the specified output directory.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- **File Path Issues**: Ensure correct paths for `documentPath` and `outputDirectory`.
- **Library Compatibility**: Verify compatibility with your .NET framework version.

## Practical Applications

Adding watermarks to diagrams has several real-world uses:
1. **Branding**: Automatically add logos or names across diagram assets.
2. **Security**: Mark sensitive documents as confidential.
