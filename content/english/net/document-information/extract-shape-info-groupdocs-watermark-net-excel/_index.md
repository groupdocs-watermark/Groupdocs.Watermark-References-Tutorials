using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options.Spreadsheet;
```

Initialize a `Watermarker` object with your Excel document path and load options to begin working on shape extraction.

## Implementation Guide

This section details the process of extracting shape information from an Excel file into manageable steps, ensuring effective use of GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET.

### Extracting Shape Information

The goal is to iterate through all worksheets and their shapes within your Excel document, extracting valuable metadata about each shape.

#### Step 1: Load the Document

Load your Excel file using `Watermarker` with appropriate load options:

```csharp
string documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/example.xlsx";
var loadOptions = new SpreadsheetLoadOptions();
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // Get the content of the spreadsheet
    SpreadsheetContent content = watermarker.GetContent<SpreadsheetContent>();
}
```

#### Step 2: Iterate Through Worksheets

Once loaded, iterate through each worksheet to access its shapes:

```csharp
foreach (SpreadsheetWorksheet worksheet in content.Worksheets)
{
    foreach (SpreadsheetShape shape in worksheet.Shapes)
    {
        // Extract and display shape details
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Display Shape Details

For each shape, extract specific properties like type, text content, dimensions, and more:

```csharp
// Example of displaying shape information
Console.WriteLine(shape.AutoShapeType);   // Auto shape type
Console.WriteLine(shape.MsoDrawingType);  // Mso drawing type
if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(shape.Text))
    Console.WriteLine(shape.Text);         // Shape's text content

if (shape.Image != null)
{
    Console.WriteLine(shape.Image.Width);
    Console.WriteLine(shape.Image.Height);
    Console.WriteLine(shape.Image.GetBytes().Length);
}

// Additional properties
Console.WriteLine(shape.Id);
Console.WriteLine(shape.AlternativeText);
Console.WriteLine(shape.X);
Console.WriteLine(shape.Y);
Console.WriteLine(shape.Width);
Console.WriteLine(shape.Height);
Console.WriteLine(shape.RotateAngle);
Console.WriteLine(shape.IsWordArt ? "True" : "False");
Console.WriteLine(shape.Name);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure the Excel document path is correctly specified to avoid file not found errors.
- Check for sufficient permissions to read the Excel files in your environment.

## Practical Applications

Understanding shape information can be crucial in various scenarios:

1. **Data Visualization**: Extracting metadata from charts and graphs to automate data analysis reports.
2. **Document Management Systems**: Integrating with systems to catalog and organize documents based on their graphical content.
3. **Content Migration**: Facilitating the transition of legacy Excel files to modern formats by preserving shape integrity.

## Performance Considerations

For optimal performance when working with large Excel files:
- Utilize asynchronous methods where applicable to prevent UI blocking in applications.
- Manage memory effectively by disposing of objects promptly after use, especially within `using` statements.
- Regularly update to the latest version of GroupDocs.Watermark for enhancements and bug fixes.

## Conclusion

This guide has walked you through using GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET to efficiently extract shape information from Excel documents. By following these steps, automate gathering valuable metadata about shapes within spreadsheets, enhancing your data management workflows.

**Next Steps:**
- Explore additional features in GroupDocs.Watermark to further enhance your applications.
