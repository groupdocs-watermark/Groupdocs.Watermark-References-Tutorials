Before diving into shape extraction, let's set up the GroupDocs.Watermark library:

**.NET CLI Installation:**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Watermark
```

**Package Manager Console:**
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Watermark
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI:**

- **Purchase:** Obtain an official license for commercial use by visiting [GroupDocs Purchase](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/).

**Basic Initialization:**
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark;
// Initialize Watermarker with your document path and load options
Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker("YourDocument.docx", new LoadOptions());
```

### Implementation Guide

#### Extracting Shape Information from Word Documents
This feature allows you to parse through each shape within a Word document, capturing essential details like dimensions, type, position, and embedded images.

##### Initializing the Document and Loading Content
1. **Load Your Document:**
   Begin by initializing your `Watermarker` object with the target Word document.
   ```csharp
   using GroupDocs.Watermark.Contents.WordProcessing;
   
   string documentPath = "YourDocument.docx";
   var loadOptions = new WordProcessingLoadOptions();
   using (var watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
   {
       // Get the content of the Word document.
       WordProcessingContent content = watermarker.GetContent<WordProcessingContent>();
       
       foreach (WordProcessingSection section in content.Sections)
       {
           foreach (WordProcessingShape shape in section.Shapes)
           {
               ProcessShape(shape);
           }
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Process Each Shape:**
   For each shape, extract and display relevant properties.
   ```csharp
   void ProcessShape(WordProcessingShape shape)
   {
       // Check if the shape is part of a header or footer
       if (shape.HeaderFooter != null)
       {
           Console.WriteLine("Shape is within a header/footer.");
       }

       // Display basic properties of the shape
       string shapeType = shape.ShapeType.ToString();
       double width = shape.Width;
       double height = shape.Height;
       bool isWordArt = shape.IsWordArt;
       float rotateAngle = shape.RotateAngle;
       string alternativeText = shape.AlternativeText;
       string name = shape.Name;
       double xPosition = shape.X;
       double yPosition = shape.Y;
       string text = shape.Text;

       Console.WriteLine($"Type: {shapeType}, Width: {width}, Height: {height}");
       
       // Check if the shape contains an image
       if (shape.Image != null)
       {
           double imageWidth = shape.Image.Width;
           double imageHeight = shape.Image.Height;
           int imageByteLength = shape.Image.GetBytes().Length;

           Console.WriteLine($"Image Width: {imageWidth}, Height: {imageHeight}");
       }

       // Display alignment properties of the shape
       string horizontalAlignment = shape.HorizontalAlignment.ToString();
       string verticalAlignment = shape.VerticalAlignment.ToString();

       Console.WriteLine($"HorizontalAlignment: {horizontalAlignment}, VerticalAlignment: {verticalAlignment}");
   }
   ```

##### Key Configuration Options:
- **LoadOptions:** Customize how documents are loaded, such as specifying password protection.
- **Shape Properties:** Tailor which properties to extract based on your needs.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed and paths are accurately specified.
- Check the document's structure; malformed sections may cause exceptions during extraction.

### Practical Applications

#### Use Cases:
1. **Automated Document Review:**
   - Extract shapes for compliance checks in legal documents or contracts.
2. **Content Migration Projects:**
   - Convert shape data into different formats for digital asset management systems.
3. **Report Generation:**
   - Analyze and generate summaries based on embedded images or charts within reports.

#### Integration Possibilities:
- Combine with other GroupDocs products, such as Conversion or Viewer, to build comprehensive document solutions.
