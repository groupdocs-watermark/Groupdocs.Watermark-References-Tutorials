// Initialize the Watermarker with a document path
Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/document.docx");
```

## Implementation Guide

We'll break down the implementation into logical steps for clarity.

### Accessing Page Properties of a Word Document Section

#### Overview
This feature allows you to retrieve and display page properties such as width, height, and margins from the first section of your Word document. It is essential for applications requiring precise control over document layouts.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
**1. Import Necessary Namespaces**
Start by including necessary namespaces:
```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Contents.WordProcessing;
```

**2. Initialize the Watermarker**
Create an instance of `Watermarker` to work with your Word document:
```csharp
string documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/document.docx";
Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath);
```

**3. Access Section Properties**
Retrieve the first section and its page properties:
```csharp
WordProcessingContent content = watermarker.GetContent<WordProcessingContent>();
var firstSection = content.Sections[0];
Console.WriteLine($"Width: {firstSection.PageSetup.PageWidth}");
Console.WriteLine($"Height: {firstSection.PageSetup.PageHeight}");
Console.WriteLine($"Top Margin: {firstSection.PageSetup.TopMargin}");
Console.WriteLine($"Bottom Margin: {firstSection.PageSetup.BottomMargin}");
```

**4. Explanation of Parameters**
- **Watermarker**: Manages the document and its properties.
- **PageWidth/PageHeight**: Returns dimensions of the page in points.
- **Margins**: Provides spacing from page edges.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure correct file paths are specified to avoid `FileNotFoundException`.
- Confirm that your Word document has at least one section with defined properties.

## Practical Applications
Here are some real-world use cases and integration possibilities:
1. **Document Formatting Tools:** Automate margin adjustments for consistency across documents.
2. **Batch Processing Systems:** Integrate into systems processing large volumes of Word files to extract layout information.
3. **Content Management Systems (CMS):** Use page properties to enforce document standards.

## Performance Considerations
Optimizing performance is crucial when handling multiple documents:
- **Memory Management:** Utilize `using` statements for automatic resource disposal.
- **Efficient Iteration:** Access only necessary sections and properties to minimize processing time.
- **Batch Processing:** Handle documents in batches rather than individually to reduce overhead.
