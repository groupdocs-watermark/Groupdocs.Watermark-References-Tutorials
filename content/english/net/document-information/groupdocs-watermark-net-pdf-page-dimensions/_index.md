2. **Environment Setup Requirements:**
   - A compatible .NET development environment (e.g., Visual Studio 2019/2022)
3. **Knowledge Prerequisites:**

   - Familiarity with handling PDF files in applications

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET
To begin using GroupDocs.Watermark, you'll first need to integrate it into your project. Here’s how:

### Installation Information

**Using .NET CLI:**

```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Watermark
```

**Package Manager Console:**

```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Watermark
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI:**
- Open NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio.
- Search for "GroupDocs.Watermark" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition
You can start with a free trial or request a temporary license to explore all features. For production use, you’ll need to purchase a license from [GroupDocs](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/).

### Basic Initialization and Setup
Once installed, ensure your project is configured correctly by adding the following namespaces:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Contents.Pdf;
using GroupDocs.Watermark.Options.Pdf;
```

## Implementation Guide
Now that we have our environment ready, let’s focus on retrieving PDF page dimensions.

### Retrieve Dimensions of a PDF Page
This feature allows you to access the width and height of any PDF page. Here's how to implement it:

#### Step 1: Load Your PDF Document
Begin by loading your PDF document using `Watermarker`. You'll need to specify the path to your file.

```csharp
string documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\document.pdf"; // Replace with your document path
var loadOptions = new PdfLoadOptions();
using (Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath, loadOptions))
{
    // The PDF content is now accessible.
}
```

#### Step 2: Access the First Page's Dimensions
Within the `using` block, you can access the dimensions of the first page.

```csharp
PdfContent pdfContent = watermarker.GetContent<PdfContent>();
double pageWidth = pdfContent.Pages[0].Width; // Retrieves the width of the first page
double pageHeight = pdfContent.Pages[0].Height; // Retrieves the height of the first page

Console.WriteLine($"Page Width: {pageWidth}");
Console.WriteLine($"Page Height: {pageHeight}");
```
**Explanation:** 
- `PdfLoadOptions` initializes loading settings.
- `GetContent<PdfContent>()` retrieves PDF-specific content.
- Accessing `.Pages[0]` fetches the first page, while `.Width` and `.Height` provide its dimensions.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure your document path is correct to avoid file not found errors.
- If accessing multiple pages, verify the index within `pdfContent.Pages`.

## Practical Applications
Understanding PDF dimensions can be vital in various scenarios:

1. **Image Resizing:** Adjust images to fit page dimensions before embedding them into documents.
2. **Layout Adjustment:** Dynamically adjust layouts based on document size for optimal viewing.
3. **Compatibility Checks:** Ensure documents meet specific size requirements for different platforms or printers.

GroupDocs.Watermark can integrate seamlessly with other systems, enhancing your document management workflows.

## Performance Considerations
To optimize performance when using GroupDocs.Watermark:
- **Resource Usage:** Monitor memory and CPU usage during processing to prevent bottlenecks.
- **Best Practices:** Dispose of `Watermarker` objects properly to free resources efficiently.

Adhering to these guidelines ensures smooth operation within your .NET applications.
