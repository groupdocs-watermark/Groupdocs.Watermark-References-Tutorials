Let’s dive into the prerequisites you need before we begin.

## Prerequisites
Before implementing this feature, ensure you have:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Install JDK 8 or higher on your machine.
- **Maven:** Set up Maven for dependency management if you choose to use it for installing GroupDocs.Watermark.
- **IDE:** Use an Integrated Development Environment like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Watermark for Java
To start working with GroupDocs.Watermark, you need to install the library and configure your environment. Here’s how:

### Maven Installation
Add the following configuration to your `pom.xml` file to include GroupDocs.Watermark in your project:

```xml
<repositories>
   <repository>
      <id>repository.groupdocs.com</id>
      <name>GroupDocs Repository</name>
      <url>https://releases.groupdocs.com/watermark/java/</url>
   </repository>
</repositories>

<dependencies>
   <dependency>
      <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
      <artifactId>groupdocs-watermark</artifactId>
      <version>24.11</version>
   </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### Direct Download
If you prefer not to use Maven, download the latest version from [GroupDocs.Watermark for Java releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/watermark/java/).

### License Acquisition
You can obtain a temporary license or purchase a full license through [GroupDocs' website](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/). This allows you to explore the full capabilities of the library.

### Basic Initialization and Setup
To initialize GroupDocs.Watermark, create an instance of `Watermarker` with your presentation file path:

```java
PresentationLoadOptions loadOptions = new PresentationLoadOptions();
Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/presentation.pptx", loadOptions);
```

## Implementation Guide
In this section, we’ll walk you through the process of adding text and image watermarks to PowerPoint presentations.

### Adding Text Watermarks
**Overview:** This feature demonstrates how to overlay text on each slide's background image.

#### Step 1: Create and Configure Watermark
Start by creating a `TextWatermark` object with your desired text and font settings:

```java
// Create a TextWatermark object
textWatermark = new TextWatermark("Protected Image", new Font("Arial", 8));
```

#### Step 2: Set Alignment and Rotation
Configure the alignment and rotation of your watermark to ensure it appears as intended on each slide.

```java
// Center align the watermark horizontally and vertically
textWatermark.setHorizontalAlignment(HorizontalAlignment.Center);
textWatermark.setVerticalAlignment(VerticalAlignment.Center);

// Rotate the watermark by 45 degrees for better visibility
textWatermark.setRotateAngle(45);

// Scale based on parent dimensions, with no additional scaling factor
textWatermark.setSizingType(SizingType.ScaleToParentDimensions);
textWatermark.setScaleFactor(1);
```

#### Step 3: Add Watermark to Each Slide
Iterate through the slides and add the watermark to those with background images:

```java
PresentationContent content = watermarker.getContent(PresentationContent.class);
for (PresentationSlide slide : content.getSlides()) {
    if (slide.getImageFillFormat().getBackgroundImage() != null) {
        // Add watermark to the slide's background image
        slide.getImageFillFormat().getBackgroundImage().add(textWatermark);
    }
}
```

### Adding Image Watermarks
**Overview:** This feature allows you to overlay an image on each slide.

#### Step 1: Create and Configure Image Watermark
Create an `ImageWatermark` object with your desired settings:

```java
// Load the watermark image
ImageWatermark imageWatermark = new ImageWatermark("path/to/watermark.png");
```

#### Step 2: Set Positioning and Opacity
Configure the position and opacity of your image watermark.

```java
imageWatermark.setHorizontalAlignment(HorizontalAlignment.Center);
imageWatermark.setVerticalAlignment(VerticalAlignment.Bottom);
imageWatermark.setOpacity(0.5f);
```

#### Step 3: Add Watermark to Each Slide
Iterate through the slides and add the image watermark:

```java
for (PresentationSlide slide : content.getSlides()) {
    slide.add(imageWatermark);
}
```

### Save and Close Resources
Finally, save your changes and close any resources:

```java
watermarker.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/presentation_output.pptx");
watermarker.close();
textWatermark.close();
imageWatermark.close();
```

## Practical Applications
Adding watermarks can serve various purposes:
1. **Branding:** Include company logos on presentation slides to enhance brand visibility during meetings.
2. **Copyright Protection:** Add copyright notices to protect intellectual property.
3. **Confidentiality Notices:** Use confidentiality labels to indicate restricted access content.
4. **Integration with Document Management Systems:** Automate watermarking in workflows for document security.

## Performance Considerations
For optimal performance when using GroupDocs.Watermark:
- Minimize the number of slides processed at once if working on large presentations.
- Manage memory efficiently by closing resources promptly after use.
- Utilize batch processing where possible to handle multiple documents.
