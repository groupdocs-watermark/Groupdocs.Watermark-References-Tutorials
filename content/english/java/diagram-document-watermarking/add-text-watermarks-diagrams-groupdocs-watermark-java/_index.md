Ready to enhance document security? Let's get started by ensuring you have everything you need!

## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or higher.
- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
- Basic understanding of Java programming.

### Required Libraries and Dependencies
We'll be using GroupDocs.Watermark for Java, which can be easily integrated into your project via Maven. Here's how you can set it up:

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Watermark for Java
To begin with, include the following in your `pom.xml` file if you're using Maven:
```xml
<repositories>
   <repository>
      <id>repository.groupdocs.com</id>
      <name>GroupDocs Repository</name>
      <url>https://releases.groupdocs.com/watermark/java/</url>
   </repository>
</repositories>

<dependencies>
   <dependency>
      <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
      <artifactId>groupdocs-watermark</artifactId>
      <version>24.11</version>
   </dependency>
</dependencies>
```
If you prefer to download directly, visit [GroupDocs.Watermark for Java releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/watermark/java/) and follow the instructions.

### License Acquisition
You can start with a free trial by downloading a temporary license from [GroupDocs.Trial Licensing](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/). For extended use, consider purchasing a full license. Once you have your license file, simply load it using:
```java
License license = new License();
license.setLicense("path/to/license/file");
```

## Implementation Guide
Now, let's dive into the implementation process.

### Adding Text Watermarks to Diagram Pages
#### Step 1: Load Your Diagram
First, load the diagram file using `DiagramLoadOptions`:
```java
String inputFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/diagram.vsdx";
Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(inputFilePath, new DiagramLoadOptions());
```
Here, `inputFilePath` is your source diagram file path.

#### Step 2: Initialize the Text Watermark
Create a `TextWatermark` object with custom text and font settings:
```java
TextWatermark textWatermark = new TextWatermark("Test watermark", new Font("Arial", 36));
textWatermark.setColor(Color.getBlue());
textWatermark.setBackground(false);
textWatermark.setRotationAngle(-45);
```
This snippet sets the watermark text, font, color, and rotation.

#### Step 3: Add Watermark to Diagram
Next, specify where you want your watermark to appear:
```java
DiagramShapeWatermarkOptions options = new DiagramShapeWatermarkOptions();
options.setPlacement(DiagramWatermarkPlacementType.Background);
watermarker.add(textWatermark, options);
```
This places the watermark on all background pages of the diagram.

#### Step 4: Save and Close
Finally, save the watermarked diagram and close the `Watermarker`:
```java
String outputFilePath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/watermarked_diagram.vsdx";
watermarker.save(outputFilePath);
watermarker.close();
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **File Path Issues**: Ensure your file paths are correct and accessible.
- **Library Versions**: Check that you're using compatible versions of Java and GroupDocs.Watermark.

## Practical Applications
Text watermarks can be invaluable in several scenarios:
1. **Document Security**: Protect diagrams shared online from unauthorized use.
2. **Branding**: Add company logos or names to documents for branding purposes.
3. **Collaboration**: Mark diagrams with user initials during collaborative projects to track contributions.

## Performance Considerations
- Use memory efficiently by closing resources promptly after use.
- Optimize the watermark's size and complexity to ensure quick processing times.
- Always test on sample files before applying changes to large batches.

## Conclusion
By now, you should have a solid understanding of how to add text watermarks to diagram pages using GroupDocs.Watermark for Java. This skill not only enhances document security but also provides branding opportunities across your digital content.
