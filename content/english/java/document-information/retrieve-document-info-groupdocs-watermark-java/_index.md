In this guide, you'll learn how to:
- Set up GroupDocs.Watermark in your Java project
- Retrieve key document information using FileInputStream
- Implement practical applications of this feature

Let's start by covering the prerequisites needed before we begin!

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following ready:
1. **Required Libraries and Versions**:
   - **GroupDocs.Watermark for Java**: Version 24.11 or later.
2. **Environment Setup Requirements**:
   - JDK installed (version 8 or higher).
   - An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
3. **Knowledge Prerequisites**:
   - Basic understanding of Java programming and I/O operations.
   - Familiarity with Maven for dependency management is beneficial.

### Setting Up GroupDocs.Watermark for Java

To integrate **GroupDocs.Watermark for Java**, you can use either Maven or a direct download approach. Here's how to set it up:

**Maven Configuration**

Add the following configuration to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<repositories>
   <repository>
      <id>repository.groupdocs.com</id>
      <name>GroupDocs Repository</name>
      <url>https://releases.groupdocs.com/watermark/java/</url>
   </repository>
</repositories>

<dependencies>
   <dependency>
      <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
      <artifactId>groupdocs-watermark</artifactId>
      <version>24.11</version>
   </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

**Direct Download**

Alternatively, you can download the latest version from [GroupDocs.Watermark for Java releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/watermark/java/).

#### License Acquisition

You can obtain a free trial license or purchase a temporary license. Follow these steps:
1. Visit the [GroupDocs Purchase page](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/) to apply for a temporary license.
2. Download and apply your license file as per instructions in the documentation.

**Basic Initialization**

Start by importing necessary classes and initializing the `Watermarker` object:

```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.Watermarker;
import java.io.FileInputStream;

// Initialize FileInputStream with your document path
FileInputStream stream = new FileInputStream("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/source.docx");

// Create a Watermarker instance
Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(stream);
```

---

### Implementation Guide

Now, let's break down the implementation process into logical steps.

#### Retrieve Document Information from File Stream

**Overview**

This feature demonstrates how to extract document information such as file type, page count, and size using `FileInputStream`.

##### Step 1: Open the File Stream

Replace `'YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/source.docx'` with your actual file path:

```java
import java.io.FileInputStream;

// Open the FileStream for the input document
FileInputStream stream = new FileInputStream("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/source.docx");
```

*Why this step?*: This initializes access to your document, allowing further processing.

##### Step 2: Initialize Watermarker Object

The `Watermarker` object is crucial as it facilitates various document manipulations:

```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.Watermarker;

// Initialize a Watermarker with the file stream
Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(stream);
```

*Key Configuration*: Ensure your file path and permissions are correct to avoid access errors.

##### Step 3: Retrieve Document Information

Use the `getDocumentInfo()` method to fetch document metadata:

```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.common.IDocumentInfo;

// Get document information
IDocumentInfo info = watermarker.getDocumentInfo();
```

*What this does*: Retrieves an object containing all relevant document details.

##### Step 4: Obtain Specific Details

Print the file type, number of pages, and size for verification:

```java
System.out.println("File type: " + info.getFileType());
System.out.println("Number of pages: " + info.getPageCount());
System.out.println("Document size: " + info.getSize() + " bytes");
```

*Why these details?*: Understanding document properties is essential for further processing and decision-making.

##### Step 5: Close Resources

Properly closing resources prevents memory leaks:

```java
// Always close the Watermarker and FileInputStream
watermarker.close();
stream.close();
```

*Best Practice*: This ensures optimal resource management, critical in large-scale applications.

### Practical Applications

Here are some real-world scenarios where retrieving document information is beneficial:
1. **Document Management Systems**: Automate file categorization based on type or size.
2. **Content Verification**: Ensure documents meet specific criteria before processing.
3. **Audit and Compliance**: Track metadata for regulatory compliance.
4. **Batch Processing Pipelines**: Optimize workflows by analyzing document properties.
5. **Integration with Cloud Services**: Streamline cloud uploads by pre-validating file attributes.

### Performance Considerations

To optimize performance when using GroupDocs.Watermark:
- Use efficient I/O operations to minimize loading times.
- Manage memory effectively by closing streams and objects promptly.
- Consider threading for handling multiple documents simultaneously, especially in batch processing scenarios.

**Best Practices**: Regularly monitor resource usage and adjust configurations based on your application's demands.

### Conclusion

You've now mastered how to retrieve document information using **GroupDocs.Watermark for Java**. This skill is invaluable in various applications involving document management and processing. As next steps, consider exploring additional features of GroupDocs.Watermark or integrating it with other systems you use.

*Call-to-Action*: Experiment by implementing this solution in your projects to see its benefits firsthand!
