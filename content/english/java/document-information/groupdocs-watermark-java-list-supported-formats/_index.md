# How to List Supported File Formats Using GroupDocs.Watermark for Java

## Introduction

Working with multiple document types can be challenging when you need to ensure compatibility with watermarking tools. The GroupDocs.Watermark library simplifies this task by supporting a wide range of file formats, enabling seamless watermark application across different documents.

This guide will show you how to use **GroupDocs.Watermark for Java** to retrieve and list all supported file formats effectively. By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand:
- How to integrate GroupDocs.Watermark into your Java projects
- The steps required to list supported file types
- Practical applications for this feature

Before we begin, let's review the prerequisites.

## Prerequisites

To implement this functionality, ensure you have:

- **Required Libraries**: Use GroupDocs.Watermark for Java version 24.11 or later.
- **Environment Setup**: Set up your development environment with JDK 8 or higher.
- **Knowledge Prerequisites**: A basic understanding of Java programming and Maven dependency management is needed.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Watermark for Java

### Installation via Maven

Add the necessary repository and dependencies to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<repositories>
   <repository>
      <id>repository.groupdocs.com</id>
      <name>GroupDocs Repository</name>
      <url>https://releases.groupdocs.com/watermark/java/</url>
   </repository>
</repositories>

<dependencies>
   <dependency>
      <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
      <artifactId>groupdocs-watermark</artifactId>
      <version>24.11</version>
   </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### Direct Download

Alternatively, download the latest version of GroupDocs.Watermark for Java from [GroupDocs releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/watermark/java/).

#### License Acquisition

To use GroupDocs.Watermark, obtain a license. Options include starting with a free trial or requesting a temporary license.

### Initialization and Setup

After adding the dependency or downloading the library, initialize it in your Java project:

```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.Watermarker;
import com.groupdocs.watermark.common.FileType;

public class WatermarkExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Initialize a watermarker object for demonstration purposes
        Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker("path/to/your/file");
        
        // Your code to list supported file formats will go here

        watermarker.close();
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Listing Supported File Formats

This feature enables you to retrieve and display all the file types that GroupDocs.Watermark supports.

#### Step 1: Retrieve All Supported File Types

Use the `FileType` class method to get an array of supported file formats:

```java
// STEP 1: Retrieve all supported file types from the GroupDocs library
FileType[] fileTypes = FileType.getSupportedFileTypes();
```

This step fetches an array of `FileType` objects, each representing a different document format.

#### Step 2: Iterate and Print File Type Names

Iterate through the retrieved file types to print their names:

```java
// STEP 2: Iterate over each file type and print its name
for (FileType fileType : fileTypes) {
    System.out.println(fileType);
}
```

This loop helps verify which formats are supported, aiding further processing.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Common Issues**: Ensure your Maven dependencies are correctly set. Check for compatibility issues with your Java version if errors occur during execution.
- **Performance Considerations**: For large lists of file types, consider logging the results to a file instead of printing them directly to the console.

## Practical Applications

Understanding which file formats GroupDocs.Watermark supports can benefit various scenarios:

1. **Document Management Systems**: Automatically apply watermarks across supported document types.
2. **Content Publishing Platforms**: Secure digital assets by watermarking PDFs, images, and other files before distribution.
3. **Legal Document Handling**: Ensure confidentiality by marking sensitive information on supported file formats.

These examples demonstrate the versatility of the GroupDocs.Watermark library in real-world applications.

## Performance Considerations

Optimizing performance when dealing with large datasets is crucial:
- **Resource Usage**: Monitor memory usage, especially if processing a vast number of files.
- **Best Practices for Java Memory Management**: Close resources like `Watermarker` objects promptly to free up system resources.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure efficient and effective use of the GroupDocs.Watermark library in your applications.
