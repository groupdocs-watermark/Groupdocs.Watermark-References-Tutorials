### Knowledge Prerequisites
Basic knowledge of Java programming and an understanding of handling document files in Java applications will be beneficial.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Watermark for Java

### Installation Information

**Maven**

Add these configurations to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<repositories>
   <repository>
      <id>repository.groupdocs.com</id>
      <name>GroupDocs Repository</name>
      <url>https://releases.groupdocs.com/watermark/java/</url>
   </repository>
</repositories>

<dependencies>
   <dependency>
      <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
      <artifactId>groupdocs-watermark</artifactId>
      <version>24.11</version>
   </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

**Direct Download**
Download the latest version from [GroupDocs.Watermark for Java releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/watermark/java/).

### License Acquisition Steps
To use GroupDocs.Watermark, consider acquiring a temporary license or purchasing one. You can start with a free trial to explore its features.

#### Basic Initialization and Setup
After installation, initialize the `Watermarker` class by specifying your document's path:

```java
String documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/document.pdf";
Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(documentPath);
```

## Implementation Guide

### Searching for Text Watermarks with Skipping Unreadable Characters
This feature is crucial when searching for text in documents where some characters might be corrupted or unreadable. Hereâ€™s how to implement it:

#### Step 1: Define the Search Criteria
Create a `TextSearchCriteria` object specifying the watermark you are looking for:

```java
String watermarkText = "Company name";
TextSearchCriteria criterion = new TextSearchCriteria(watermarkText);
```

#### Step 2: Enable Skipping of Unreadable Characters
Configure your search criteria to skip unreadable characters during the process:

```java
criterion.setSkipUnreadableCharacters(true);
```
**Explanation**: This setting ensures that unreadable characters do not interfere with watermark detection, enhancing accuracy.

#### Step 3: Perform the Search
Use the `watermarker.search()` method with your criteria:

```java
PossibleWatermarkCollection result = watermarker.search(criterion);
// Output the number of possible watermarks found.
```
**Troubleshooting Tip**: If no results are returned, verify the document path and check for any unreadable sections that might need preprocessing.

### Closing Resources
Always remember to close resources after your operations:

```java
watermarker.close();
```

## Practical Applications
- **Document Management Systems**: Integrate this functionality to manage and search large volumes of documents efficiently.
- **Legal Document Analysis**: Quickly identify watermarks in legal documents, ensuring authenticity without manual checks.
- **Content Verification Tools**: Use for verifying content integrity in digital publishing workflows.

Integration with other systems can further enhance document processing capabilities by leveraging additional GroupDocs APIs.

## Performance Considerations
### Optimizing Performance
To ensure optimal performance:
- Manage memory usage by closing resources promptly.
- Process documents in batches if dealing with large datasets.

### Resource Usage Guidelines
Monitor CPU and memory usage, especially when handling high-resolution PDFs or large document collections. 

### Best Practices for Java Memory Management
Utilize try-with-resources or explicit close methods to manage `Watermarker` instances efficiently.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, you've learned how to search for text watermarks in PDF documents using GroupDocs.Watermark for Java while skipping unreadable characters. This functionality is essential for ensuring accurate watermark detection without being hindered by document corruption.

### Next Steps
Try implementing these features in your projects and explore additional functionalities provided by GroupDocs.Watermark to enhance your document processing capabilities.
