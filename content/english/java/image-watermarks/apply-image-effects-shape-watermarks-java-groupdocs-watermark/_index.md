```

With your environment ready, let's move to implementing image effects on shape watermarks.

## Implementation Guide

### Applying Image Effects to Shape Watermarks

This feature allows you to customize how an image watermark appears in your presentations by adjusting its brightness, contrast, and more. Let’s break down the steps:

#### Step 1: Load Your Presentation
Firstly, load your .NET presentation file with custom options if needed:

```java
PresentationLoadOptions loadOptions = new PresentationLoadOptions();
Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/presentation.pptx", loadOptions);
```

#### Step 2: Create and Configure the Image Watermark
Create an `ImageWatermark` using your preferred image file, such as a logo:

```java
ImageWatermark watermark = new ImageWatermark("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/logo.png");
```

Next, configure various effects to customize the appearance of your watermark:

```java
PresentationImageEffects effects = new PresentationImageEffects();
effects.setBrightness(0.7); // Set brightness to 70% of original.
effects.setContrast(0.6);   // Set contrast to 60% of original.
effects.setChromaKey(Color.getRed()); // Apply chroma key using the color red for transparency.

// Enable and configure border line settings
effects.getBorderLineFormat().setEnabled(true);
effects.getBorderLineFormat().setWeight(1); // Set border weight to 1.
```

#### Step 3: Add Watermark with Effects
Now, apply your configured watermark with effects to the presentation:

```java
PresentationWatermarkSlideOptions options = new PresentationWatermarkSlideOptions();
options.setEffects(effects);

watermarker.add(watermark, options);
```

#### Step 4: Save and Close Resources
Finally, save the modified presentation and close all resources:

```java
watermarker.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/out_presentation.pptx");
watermarker.close();
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure your file paths are correctly specified.
- Verify that you’re using a supported version of GroupDocs.Watermark.
