import com.groupdocs.watermark.options.SpreadsheetLoadOptions;

String inputPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/spreadsheet.xlsx";
SpreadsheetLoadOptions loadOptions = new SpreadsheetLoadOptions();
Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(inputPath, loadOptions);
```
## Implementation Guide

### Loading an Excel Document for Watermarking

**Overview:**
This section covers how to load your Excel spreadsheet into the Java environment using GroupDocs.Watermark.
1. **Set Up Load Options**
   Begin by creating `SpreadsheetLoadOptions`:
   ```java
   SpreadsheetLoadOptions loadOptions = new SpreadsheetLoadOptions();
   ```
2. **Initialize Watermarker**
   Use these options to initialize the `Watermarker`:
   ```java
   String inputPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/spreadsheet.xlsx";
   Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(inputPath, loadOptions);
   ```
### Adding an Image Watermark as a Background

**Overview:**
Here we'll add an image watermark to all sheets within the Excel document.
1. **Prepare the Image Watermark**
   Create an `ImageWatermark` object with your desired image:
   ```java
   import com.groupdocs.watermark.options.SpreadsheetBackgroundWatermarkOptions;
   import com.groupdocs.watermark.watermarks.ImageWatermark;

   String imagePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/logo.gif";
   ImageWatermark watermark = new ImageWatermark(imagePath);
   ```
2. **Configure Background Watermark Options**
   Set up `SpreadsheetBackgroundWatermarkOptions` to define the positioning and appearance of your watermark:
   ```java
   SpreadsheetBackgroundWatermarkOptions options = new SpreadsheetBackgroundWatermarkOptions();
   ```
3. **Add the Watermark**
   Add the image watermark using these settings:
   ```java
   watermarker.add(watermark, options);
   ```
### Saving and Closing the Document

**Overview:**
Finally, save your changes to a new file and release resources.
1. **Specify Output Path**
   Define where you want to save the modified spreadsheet:
   ```java
   String outputPath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/spreadsheet_with_watermark.xlsx";
   ```
2. **Save the Document**
   Save the document using `save()` method:
   ```java
   watermarker.save(outputPath);
   ```
3. **Release Resources**
   Properly close the `Watermarker` to free up system resources:
   ```java
   watermarker.close();
   ```
## Practical Applications

- **Branding:** Embed company logos in all client-shared Excel files.
- **Confidentiality:** Secure sensitive data by watermarking reports before sharing.
- **Document Tracking:** Distinguish between draft and final versions of documents.

These practical applications demonstrate how versatile GroupDocs.Watermark can be when integrated into your document management workflows.
## Performance Considerations

To optimize performance:
- Use efficient image formats for watermarks to reduce processing time.
- Manage memory usage by releasing resources immediately after operations.
- Employ best practices in Java programming, such as using try-with-resources for automatic resource management.
By adhering to these guidelines, you can ensure smooth and efficient watermarking processes with GroupDocs.Watermark.
