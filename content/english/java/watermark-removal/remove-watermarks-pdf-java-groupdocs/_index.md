public class WatermarkSetup {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/document.pdf");
        // Additional setup code here...
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Feature: Find and Remove Watermarks

#### Overview
This feature shows how to search for and remove specific watermarks from a PDF document using GroupDocs.Watermark. It’s essential for maintaining document integrity.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

##### Initialize Watermarker
First, create a `Watermarker` instance with the path to your document:
```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.Watermarker;

public class FeatureFindAndRemoveWatermark {
    public static void run() {
        // Replace with your actual directory.
        Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/document.pdf");
        
        // Additional steps will follow...
    }
}
```

##### Search for Possible Watermarks
Use the `search` method to find all potential watermarks:
```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.search.PossibleWatermarkCollection;

// ...
PossibleWatermarkCollection possibleWatermarks = watermarker.search();
```
This step returns a collection of watermark objects that might be present in your document.

##### Remove a Watermark at a Specified Index
To remove a specific watermark, use the `removeAt` method:
```java
// Remove the first found watermark
possibleWatermarks.removeAt(0);
```

Alternatively, you can target a specific watermark using an index with `get_Item`:
```java
// Another way to remove using get_Item
possibleWatermarks.remove(possibleWatermarks.get_Item(0));
```

##### Save the Modified Document
After removing the watermarks, save your changes to a new file:
```java
// Replace with your actual directory.
wartermarker.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/output_document.pdf");
```

##### Close Watermarker Instance
Always close the `Watermarker` instance to free up resources:
```java
watermarker.close();
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Common Issues:** Ensure paths are correct and accessible. Check for version compatibility.
- **Performance Optimization:** Use resource management techniques like closing streams promptly.

## Practical Applications
1. **Document Clean-Up:** Remove watermarks from documents before sharing them professionally or publishing online.
2. **Archival Processing:** Prepare documents for archiving by removing unnecessary watermarks.
3. **Legal Document Management:** Ensure compliance and clarity in legal documents by temporarily removing client-specific watermarks during review.

## Performance Considerations
Optimizing performance when using GroupDocs.Watermark involves:
- **Efficient Resource Use:** Always close `Watermarker` instances to prevent memory leaks.
- **Memory Management:** For large PDFs, consider processing them in chunks if possible.
- **Version Updates:** Regularly update the library for improved performance and new features.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, you've learned how to set up and use GroupDocs.Watermark for Java to find and remove watermarks from PDF documents. We covered everything from setting up your environment to implementing watermark removal efficiently.
