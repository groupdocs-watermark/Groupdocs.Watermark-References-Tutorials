## Implementation Guide

### Overview of Removing Section-Specific Watermarks

In this section, we'll focus on identifying and removing both text and image watermarks from a specific section within your Word document.

#### Step 1: Initialize Loading Options

Start by setting up the loading options for your Word document. This step helps in preparing the document for processing.

```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.options.WordProcessingLoadOptions;
WordProcessingLoadOptions loadOptions = new WordProcessingLoadOptions();
```

#### Step 2: Define Search Criteria

Define the criteria to locate both text and image watermarks within your document section. This involves setting up search parameters that match the watermark content.

```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.search.ImageDctHashSearchCriteria;
import com.groupdocs.watermark.search.TextSearchCriteria;
String imagePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/logo.png";
String companyName = "Company Name";
ImageSearchCriteria imageSearchCriteria = new ImageDctHashSearchCriteria(imagePath);
TextSearchCriteria textSearchCriteria = new TextSearchCriteria(companyName);
```

#### Step 3: Locate and Remove Watermarks

Access the document's content, search for watermarks in a specific section using the defined criteria, and remove them.

```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.Watermarker;
import com.groupdocs.watermark.contents.WordProcessingContent;
import com.groupdocs.watermark.search.PossibleWatermarkCollection;
WordProcessingContent content = watermarker.getContent(WordProcessingContent.class);

PossibleWatermarkCollection possibleWatermarks = 
    content.getSections().get_Item(0).search(textSearchCriteria.or(imageSearchCriteria));

for (int i = possibleWatermarks.getCount() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    possibleWatermarks.removeAt(i);
}
```

#### Step 4: Save and Close

Finally, save the modified document to a new location and close the watermarker resource.

```java
// Define output path for the modified document
String outputPath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/modified_document.docx";
watermarker.save(outputPath);
// Release resources by closing the watermarker
watermarker.close();
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Document Path Issues:** Ensure that the paths to your input and logo image files are correctly specified.
- **License Problems:** Verify your license setup if you encounter any limitations during testing.

## Practical Applications

Here are some real-world use cases for removing watermarks from Word documents:
1. **Editing Legal Documents:** Remove branding or identification marks before sharing official contracts.
2. **Preparing Reports:** Clean up draft reports for presentation by eliminating watermark placeholders.
3. **Collaborative Editing:** Ensure that sections of a document shared among team members are free from distracting marks.

## Performance Considerations

### Tips for Optimization:
- **Efficient Resource Management:** Close watermarker resources promptly to prevent memory leaks.
- **Selective Processing:** Process only the necessary sections or pages to save time and resources.

Adhering to these best practices will help you maximize performance when using GroupDocs.Watermark with Java applications.
