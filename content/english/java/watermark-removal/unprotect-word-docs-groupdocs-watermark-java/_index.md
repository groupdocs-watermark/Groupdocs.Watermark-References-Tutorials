import com.groupdocs.watermark.options.WordProcessingLoadOptions;

public class DocumentUnprotectSetup {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        WordProcessingLoadOptions loadOptions = new WordProcessingLoadOptions();
        Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker("path/to/document.docx", loadOptions);
        
        // Add your code here
        
        watermarker.close();  // Always close the Watermarker to release resources
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Unprotecting a Word Document

This feature allows you to remove password protection from a Word document using GroupDocs.Watermark.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation:

**1. Create Load Options:**

Start by creating load options for your Word document. This ensures the application can handle files regardless of their initial protection settings.

```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.options.WordProcessingLoadOptions;

WordProcessingLoadOptions loadOptions = new WordProcessingLoadOptions();
```

**2. Initialize Watermarker:**

Initialize a `Watermarker` instance with the path to your protected document and load options.

```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.Watermarker;

Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/document.docx", loadOptions);
```

**3. Access Document Content:**

Retrieve the content of the Word document as `WordProcessingContent`. This object allows you to interact with the document's properties and contents.

```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.contents.WordProcessingContent;

WordProcessingContent content = watermarker.getContent(WordProcessingContent.class);
```

**4. Unprotect the Document:**

Use the `unprotect()` method to remove any password protection from the Word document. This is crucial for accessing and editing protected files.

```java
content.unprotect();
```

**5. Save the Unprotected Document:**

After unprotecting, save the document to a new location to ensure your original file remains unchanged.

```java
watermarker.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/unprotected_document.docx");
```

**6. Release Resources:**

Close the `Watermarker` instance to release any locked resources and prevent memory leaks.

```java
watermarker.close();
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **File Not Found:** Ensure your file paths are correct.
- **Permission Issues:** Verify that you have read/write permissions for the directories involved.
- **Library Version Mismatch:** Double-check that your GroupDocs.Watermark version matches the one specified in your dependencies.

## Practical Applications

Unprotecting Word documents can be useful in several real-world scenarios, such as:

1. **Document Management Systems:** Automatically unprotect user-uploaded files for easier processing and editing.
2. **Legal Document Processing:** Remove protection from client-provided legal documents to facilitate review and amendments.
3. **Educational Platforms:** Allow students to access protected study materials without password barriers.

Integration with other systems, such as content management platforms or document workflow engines, can further enhance productivity and streamline operations.

## Performance Considerations

To ensure optimal performance when using GroupDocs.Watermark:
- **Optimize Resource Usage:** Always close `Watermarker` instances promptly.
- **Manage Memory Efficiently:** Use Java's memory management features to handle large documents without running into memory issues.
- **Benchmark Your Application:** Regularly test the application's performance under different loads and document sizes.
