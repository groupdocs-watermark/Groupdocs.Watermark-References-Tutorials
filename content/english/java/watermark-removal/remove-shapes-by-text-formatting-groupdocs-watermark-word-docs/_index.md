# How to Remove Shapes by Text Formatting in Word Docs with GroupDocs.Watermark for Java

## Introduction

Managing and modifying document content is crucial in the realm of document processing, whether you're a software developer or a business professional. This tutorial focuses on using **GroupDocs.Watermark for Java** to efficiently remove shapes based on text formatting criteria from Word documents. By leveraging this powerful library, you can automate document editing tasks, saving time and reducing errors.

In this guide, we will cover:
- Loading a Word document using GroupDocs.Watermark.
- Removing specific shapes by analyzing their text formatting.
- Saving your modified document effectively.

Let’s explore how to implement these features in Java!

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following prerequisites met:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or higher installed on your system.
- **Maven** or direct dependency management for integrating GroupDocs.Watermark.
- Basic knowledge of Java and document processing concepts.

These steps will set up your environment to work with GroupDocs.Watermark effectively.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Watermark for Java

To start, you need to integrate the GroupDocs.Watermark library into your Java project. Follow these instructions:

### Maven Setup

Add the following repository and dependency configurations in your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<repositories>
   <repository>
      <id>repository.groupdocs.com</id>
      <name>GroupDocs Repository</name>
      <url>https://releases.groupdocs.com/watermark/java/</url>
   </repository>
</repositories>

<dependencies>
   <dependency>
      <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
      <artifactId>groupdocs-watermark</artifactId>
      <version>24.11</version>
   </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### Direct Download

Alternatively, you can download the latest version from [GroupDocs.Watermark for Java releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/watermark/java/).

### License Acquisition

To use GroupDocs.Watermark, obtain a license by visiting their site for options like a free trial, temporary licenses, or purchasing a full license.

### Basic Initialization and Setup

Once installed, initialize the library in your Java project to begin using its features:

```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.Watermarker;
import com.groupdocs.watermark.options.WordProcessingLoadOptions;

public class DocumentSetup {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        WordProcessingLoadOptions loadOptions = new WordProcessingLoadOptions();
        Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/inputDocument.docx", loadOptions);
        
        // Additional setup and operations here
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

Now, let's break down the process into logical sections to implement specific features.

### Feature 1: Loading a Word Document with GroupDocs.Watermark

To begin, you need to load your target document. This step is crucial as it prepares the document for further processing.

#### Step-by-step:

**Initialize Load Options**

Create an instance of `WordProcessingLoadOptions` to define how the Word file should be loaded.

```java
WordProcessingLoadOptions loadOptions = new WordProcessingLoadOptions();
```

**Load the Document**

Use the `Watermarker` class with your document path and the load options you've set up:

```java
String inputFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/inputDocument.docx";
Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(inputFilePath, loadOptions);
```

This step initializes the environment to work on your Word document.

### Feature 2: Removing Shapes Based on Text Formatting

Next, we focus on the core functionality—removing specific shapes from sections of a Word document based on text formatting criteria.

#### Overview:

Iterate through each section and shape within the document. Identify shapes with specific text formatting (e.g., red Arial font) and remove them.

**Iterate Through Document Sections**

Access the content, then loop over each section to find relevant shapes:

```java
WordProcessingContent content = watermarker.getContent(WordProcessingContent.class);

for (WordProcessingSection section : content.getSections()) {
    for (int i = section.getShapes().getCount() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        // Access and evaluate each shape's formatted text fragments
```

**Evaluate Text Formatting**

Check if a shape’s text formatting matches your criteria, such as specific font color or family:

```java
for (FormattedTextFragment fragment : section.getShapes().get_Item(i).getFormattedTextFragments()) {
    if (fragment.getForegroundColor().equals(Color.getRed()) && 
        "Arial".equals(fragment.getFont().getFamilyName())) {

        // Remove the shape based on criteria
        section.getShapes().removeAt(i);
        break;
    }
}
```

**Key Considerations**

- Ensure you iterate in reverse to avoid index issues when removing items.
- Use clear and specific formatting checks for precision.

### Feature 3: Saving and Closing the Watermarker

After processing, save your changes and properly close the `Watermarker` instance.

#### Overview:

Finalize document modifications by saving them and releasing resources associated with the `Watermarker`.

**Save Changes**

Define the output file path and use the `save()` method to store changes:

```java
String outputFilePath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/processedDocument.docx";
watermarker.save(outputFilePath);
```

**Close Watermarker**

Properly close the instance to free up resources:

```java
watermarker.close();
```

## Practical Applications

Understanding how these features can be applied in real-world scenarios enhances their value. Here are a few use cases:

1. **Automating Document Cleanup**: Remove unwanted shapes from official documents before archiving.
2. **Batch Processing**: Apply this solution to process multiple Word files efficiently, maintaining consistent formatting standards.
3. **Document Standardization**: Ensure all company documents follow specific styling rules by automatically removing non-compliant elements.

## Performance Considerations

For optimal performance when using GroupDocs.Watermark:

- **Optimize Resource Usage**: Close `Watermarker` instances promptly to free memory.
- **Manage Large Files Efficiently**: Break down large document processing tasks into smaller chunks if necessary.
- **Leverage Java Memory Management**: Ensure efficient garbage collection by managing object lifecycles effectively.
