## Implementation Guide
### Removing Attachments from Excel Worksheets
Learn how to identify and remove unnecessary attachments based on the following criteria:
1. The attachment is a broken link (file doesn't exist).
2. The attached file is encrypted (password protected).

#### Step 1: Load the Excel Document
Start by loading your Excel document into the `Watermarker` class:
```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.Watermarker;
import com.groupdocs.watermark.contents.SpreadsheetContent;
import com.groupdocs.watermark.options.SpreadsheetLoadOptions;

SpreadsheetLoadOptions loadOptions = new SpreadsheetLoadOptions();
Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/spreadsheet.xlsx", loadOptions);
```

#### Step 2: Access Worksheet Content
Retrieve the content of your spreadsheet:
```java
SpreadsheetContent content = watermarker.getContent(SpreadsheetContent.class);
```

#### Step 3: Iterate Through Worksheets
Loop through each worksheet and check for removable attachments:
```java
for (SpreadsheetWorksheet worksheet : content.getWorksheets()) {
    for (int i = worksheet.getAttachments().getCount() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        SpreadsheetAttachment attachment = worksheet.getAttachments().get_Item(i);
        
        if ((attachment.isLink() && !new File(attachment.getSourceFullName()).exists()) ||
            attachment.getDocumentInfo().isEncrypted()) {
            worksheet.getAttachments().removeAt(i);
        }
    }
}
```

#### Step 4: Save Changes
After processing, save your changes:
```java
watermarker.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/spreadsheet.xlsx");
watermarker.close();
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure file paths are correct to avoid `FileNotFoundException`.
- Verify the version of GroupDocs.Watermark is compatible with your project setup.

## Practical Applications
Removing attachments can be useful in:
1. **Data Cleanup**: Automating the removal of obsolete or broken links before sharing datasets.
2. **Security**: Ensuring no sensitive encrypted files are included inadvertently.
3. **Integration with ETL Pipelines**: Pre-processing data for extraction, transformation, and loading tasks.

## Performance Considerations
- Optimize memory usage by disposing of resources promptly after use.
- For large Excel files, consider processing in smaller chunks.
- Monitor thread management if integrating into a multi-threaded application.
