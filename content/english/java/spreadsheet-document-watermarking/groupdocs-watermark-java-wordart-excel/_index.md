### Implementation Guide

#### Feature Overview: Adding WordArt Watermark

This section will guide you through adding a modern WordArt watermark to an Excel document using GroupDocs.Watermark for Java.

##### Step 1: Load the Excel Document

Start by loading your target Excel file. Use `SpreadsheetLoadOptions` for this purpose:

```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.Watermarker;
import com.groupdocs.watermark.options.SpreadsheetLoadOptions;

// Initialize load options and watermarker.
SpreadsheetLoadOptions loadOptions = new SpreadsheetLoadOptions();
Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/spreadsheet.xlsx", loadOptions);
```

##### Step 2: Create a TextWatermark

Define the text and appearance of your watermark using `TextWatermark`:

```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.watermarks.Font;
import com.groupdocs.watermark.watermarks.TextWatermark;

// Configure font and watermark text.
TextWatermark textWatermark = new TextWatermark("Test watermark", new Font("Arial", 8));
```

##### Step 3: Set WordArt Options

Set options to apply the watermark to a specific worksheet using `SpreadsheetWatermarkModernWordArtOptions`:

```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.options.SpreadsheetWatermarkModernWordArtOptions;

// Apply watermark to the first sheet.
SpreadsheetWatermarkModernWordArtOptions options = new SpreadsheetWatermarkModernWordArtOptions();
options.setWorksheetIndex(0);
```

##### Step 4: Add and Save Watermark

Add the configured watermark and save the document:

```java
// Add watermark and save the watermarked file.
watermarker.add(textWatermark, options);
watermarker.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/watermarked_spreadsheet.xlsx");
// Release resources.
watermarker.close();
```

### Practical Applications

1. **Document Security**: Protecting confidential financial data by embedding company logos as watermarks.
2. **Branding**: Enhancing brand visibility on client-shared documents.
