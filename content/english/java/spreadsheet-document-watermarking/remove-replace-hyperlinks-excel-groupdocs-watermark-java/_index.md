## Implementation Guide

### Remove Hyperlinks from Shapes and Charts in Excel

**Overview:** Removing hyperlinks from shapes or charts can declutter your spreadsheets, making them more manageable.

#### Steps to Implement:

1. **Load Your Document**
   Start by loading the Excel document using `Watermarker` with appropriate load options:

    ```java
    import com.groupdocs.watermark.Watermarker;
    import com.groupdocs.watermark.contents.SpreadsheetContent;
    import com.groupdocs.watermark.options.SpreadsheetLoadOptions;

    public class RemoveHyperlinks {
        public static void run() {
            SpreadsheetLoadOptions loadOptions = new SpreadsheetLoadOptions();
            Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/spreadsheet.xlsx", loadOptions);
            
            // Your code continues here...
        }
    }
    ```

2. **Access Content and Modify Hyperlinks**
   Get the spreadsheet content to access specific shapes or charts:

    ```java
    SpreadsheetContent content = watermarker.getContent(SpreadsheetContent.class);
    
    // Remove hyperlinks from a chart in Worksheet 1
    content.getWorksheets().get_Item(0).getCharts().get_Item(0).setHyperlink(null);
    
    // Similarly, remove hyperlink from a shape in Worksheet 1
    content.getWorksheets().get_Item(0).getShapes().get_Item(0).setHyperlink(null);
    ```

3. **Save and Close**
   Once modifications are done, save your changes:

    ```java
    watermarker.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/spreadsheet_modified.xlsx");
    watermarker.close();
    ```

### Replace Hyperlinks in Shapes and Charts

**Overview:** Replacing hyperlinks is useful for updating links to more current or relevant URLs.

#### Steps to Implement:

1. **Load Your Document**
   Similar to removing, start by loading the document as shown above.

2. **Access Content and Update Hyperlinks**
   Modify the hyperlinks as needed:

    ```java
    // Replace hyperlink for a chart in Worksheet 0
    content.getWorksheets().get_Item(0).getCharts().get_Item(0).setHyperlink("https://www.aspose.com/");
    
    // Replace hyperlink for a shape in Worksheet 0
    content.getWorksheets().get_Item(0).getShapes().get_Item(0).setHyperlink("https://www.groupdocs.com/");
    ```

3. **Save and Close**
   Save the document with updated links:

    ```java
    watermarker.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/spreadsheet_modified.xlsx");
    watermarker.close();
    ```

## Practical Applications

- **Data Cleaning**: Automate hyperlink removal for datasets requiring a clean format.
