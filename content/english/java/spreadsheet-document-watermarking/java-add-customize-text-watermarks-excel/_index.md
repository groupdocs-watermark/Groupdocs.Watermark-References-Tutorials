## Implementation Guide
### Adding Text Watermarks to Spreadsheets
#### Overview
This section will guide you through adding a basic text watermark to an Excel file using GroupDocs.Watermark. This feature is perfect for marking documents as "Confidential" or branding them with company logos.
#### Step-by-Step Instructions
**Load the Excel Document**
First, initialize the `Watermarker` class by specifying your document's path and load options:
```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.Watermarker;
import com.groupdocs.watermark.contents.SpreadsheetLoadOptions;

// Initialize load options
SpreadsheetLoadOptions loadOptions = new SpreadsheetLoadOptions();

// Create a watermarker instance for the Excel file
Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/spreadsheet.xlsx", loadOptions);
```
**Create and Configure Text Watermark**
Next, create a `TextWatermark` object. Customize it with your desired text, font style, size, color, and alignment:
```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.options.HorizontalAlignment;
import com.groupdocs.watermark.options.VerticalAlignment;
import com.groupdocs.watermark.watermarks.Color;
import com.groupdocs.watermark.watermarks.Font;
import com.groupdocs.watermark.watermarks.TextWatermark;

// Create a text watermark
TextWatermark watermark = new TextWatermark("Confidential", new Font("Segoe UI", 19));

// Set size, alignment and color of the watermark
watermark.setSizingType(TextWatermark.SIZING_TYPE.FIT_TO_PAGE);
watermark.setHorizontalAlignment(HorizontalAlignment.Center);
watermark.setVerticalAlignment(VerticalAlignment.Center);
```
**Save and Close Document**
Finally, save your changes to a new file and close the watermarker:
```java
// Save the watermarked document
watermarker.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/spreadsheet_watermarked.xlsx");

// Release resources
watermarker.close();
```
### Applying Text Effects to Watermarks in Spreadsheets
#### Overview
Enhance your watermark by applying text effects like line styles and colors for better visibility or aesthetics.
**Customize Line Format**
Initialize a `SpreadsheetTextEffects` object to modify the line format of your watermark:
```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.options.SpreadsheetLineFormat;
import com.groupdocs.watermark.options.SpreadsheetDashStyle;
import com.groupdocs.watermark.options.SpreadsheetLineStyle;

// Set up text effects for the watermark
SpreadsheetTextEffects effects = new SpreadsheetTextEffects();
effects.getLineFormat().setEnabled(true);
effects.getLineFormat().setColor(Color.getRed());
effects.getLineFormat().setDashStyle(SpreadsheetDashStyle.DashDotDot);
effects.getLineFormat().setLineStyle(SpreadsheetLineStyle.Triple);
effects.getLineFormat().setWeight(1);
```
**Apply Effects to Watermark Options**
Integrate these effects into your watermark options:
```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.options.SpreadsheetWatermarkShapeOptions;

// Attach effects to the watermark shape options
SpreadsheetWatermarkShapeOptions options = new SpreadsheetWatermarkShapeOptions();
options.setEffects(effects);
```
With this setup, you can now apply visually appealing watermarks to your spreadsheets.
## Practical Applications
Text watermarked spreadsheets have a wide array of uses:
1. **Confidential Documents:** Mark sensitive company reports or financial statements.
2. **Branding Purposes:** Use your company logo as a watermark for branding documents shared with clients.
3. **Legal Documentation:** Ensure that legal agreements and contracts are clearly marked.
These use cases demonstrate how versatile text watermarks can be in protecting and personalizing your documents.
## Performance Considerations
When working with large Excel files, consider the following tips to optimize performance:
- Minimize the number of iterations over document content.
- Close resources promptly using try-with-resources or explicit `close()` calls.
- Monitor memory usage and adjust JVM settings if necessary for larger datasets.
By keeping these considerations in mind, you can ensure efficient processing with GroupDocs.Watermark.
## Conclusion
You’ve now learned how to add and customize text watermarks in Excel files using GroupDocs.Watermark for Java. This feature is a powerful tool for protecting your documents and maintaining brand integrity. As you become more familiar with this library, explore its other capabilities to enhance document security further.
