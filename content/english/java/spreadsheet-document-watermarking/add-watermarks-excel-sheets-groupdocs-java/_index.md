// Initialize Watermarker with your document
Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/spreadsheet.xlsx");
```

## Implementation Guide

### Add Text Watermark to a Worksheet
Adding text watermarks can help protect your Excel files by marking them as confidential or indicating ownership. Let's add a text watermark to the first worksheet.

#### Step 1: Load the Spreadsheet Document
```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.options.SpreadsheetLoadOptions;

SpreadsheetLoadOptions loadOptions = new SpreadsheetLoadOptions();
Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/spreadsheet.xlsx", loadOptions);
```

#### Step 2: Create a Text Watermark
```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.watermarks.Font;
import com.groupdocs.watermark.watermarks.TextWatermark;

TextWatermark textWatermark = new TextWatermark("Confidential", new Font("Arial", 12));
textWatermark.setRotateAngle(-45);
```
Here, we specify the watermark's font and rotation angle to enhance visibility.

#### Step 3: Configure the Watermark
```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.options.SpreadsheetWatermarkShapeOptions;

SpreadsheetWatermarkShapeOptions options = new SpreadsheetWatermarkShapeOptions();
options.setWorksheetIndex(0); // Apply to the first worksheet

watermarker.add(textWatermark, options);
```

#### Step 4: Save and Close Resources
```java
watermarker.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/watermarked_spreadsheet.xlsx");
watermarker.close();
textWatermark.close();
```

### Add Image Watermark to a Worksheet
Similarly, image watermarks can add a layer of branding or additional security.

#### Step 1: Load the Spreadsheet Document
Reuse the `SpreadsheetLoadOptions` and initialize as shown previously.

#### Step 2: Create an Image Watermark
```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.watermarks.ImageWatermark;

ImageWatermark imageWatermark = new ImageWatermark("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/logo.png");
imageWatermark.setOpacity(0.5);
```
Configure opacity to ensure the watermark blends well with your content.

#### Step 3: Configure the Watermark
```java
SpreadsheetWatermarkShapeOptions options = new SpreadsheetWatermarkShapeOptions();
options.setWorksheetIndex(1); // Apply to the second worksheet

watermarker.add(imageWatermark, options);
```

#### Step 4: Save and Close Resources
Reuse the saving and closing steps as described in the text watermark section.

## Practical Applications
- **Confidentiality**: Marking sensitive data with watermarks.
- **Branding**: Adding logos to company documents.
- **Document Tracking**: Prevent unauthorized distribution by marking ownership.

These applications highlight how versatile GroupDocs.Watermark can be across different use cases.

## Performance Considerations
When working with large Excel files or adding multiple watermarks, consider the following:
- **Optimize Image Size**: Use lower-resolution images for faster processing.
- **Memory Management**: Close `Watermarker` instances promptly to free resources.
- **Batch Processing**: If dealing with many documents, process them in batches.

## Conclusion
By now, you should be comfortable adding text and image watermarks to your Excel worksheets using GroupDocs.Watermark for Java. This powerful tool not only secures your data but also offers customization options to fit your needs. To take your skills further, explore additional watermarking features available in the library.
