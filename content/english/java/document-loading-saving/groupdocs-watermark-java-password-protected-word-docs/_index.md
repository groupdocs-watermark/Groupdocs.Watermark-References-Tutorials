## Implementation Guide

### Loading Password-Protected Word Processing Document

This section details how to load an encrypted document using the `WordProcessingLoadOptions` class from GroupDocs.Watermark.

#### Step 1: Import Required Packages
```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.Watermarker;
import com.groupdocs.watermark.options.WordProcessingLoadOptions;
```
These imports are essential for accessing watermarking features and specifying load options for encrypted documents.

#### Step 2: Set Up Load Options with Password
Create a `WordProcessingLoadOptions` object to specify the password required for loading the protected document:
```java
String filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/protected-document.docx"; // Replace with your document path.
WordProcessingLoadOptions loadOptions = new WordProcessingLoadOptions();
loadOptions.setPassword("P@$$w0rd"); // Set the correct password here.
```
**Explanation**: The `setPassword` method enables access to documents protected by a password, allowing you to proceed with loading and editing.

#### Step 3: Initialize Watermarker
Use the file path and load options to initialize the `Watermarker` object:
```java
Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(filePath, loadOptions);
```
**Explanation**: This step creates an instance of `Watermarker`, which acts as a bridge for managing documents and applying or removing watermarks.

#### Step 4: Add Watermark
Create and add a text watermark to your document:
```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.watermarks.Font;
import com.groupdocs.watermark.watermarks.TextWatermark;

TextWatermark watermark = new TextWatermark("Test watermark", new Font("Arial", 12));
watermarker.add(watermark);
```
**Explanation**: The `TextWatermark` class allows you to specify the text, font, and other properties of your watermark. This example adds a simple "Test watermark" with Arial font.

#### Step 5: Save and Close
Save changes to a new file and close the watermarker to release resources:
```java
String outputFilePath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/protected-document.docx";
watermarker.save(outputFilePath);
watermarker.close();
```
**Explanation**: Saving ensures that all modifications, including added watermarks, are preserved in your document. Closing the `Watermarker` is crucial for freeing up system resources.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Incorrect Password**: Ensure that you have entered the correct password. If unsure, verify with the document owner.
- **File Path Errors**: Double-check file paths to ensure they point to valid locations on your system.
- **Dependency Issues**: Make sure all dependencies are correctly configured in your `pom.xml` or directly downloaded.

## Practical Applications
1. **Legal Document Management**: Add watermarks to confidential legal documents before sharing them with external parties.
2. **Educational Material Distribution**: Protect educational content by watermarking it, ensuring that students can access but not easily distribute the material.
3. **Corporate Reports**: Securely share financial or strategic reports by adding company logos as watermarks.

Integrating GroupDocs.Watermark allows for seamless integration with existing document management systems and workflows.

## Performance Considerations
- **Optimize Load Times**: Minimize file size where possible to improve load times, especially when dealing with large documents.
- **Resource Management**: Always close `Watermarker` instances after use to prevent memory leaks.
- **Batch Processing**: For handling multiple files, consider implementing batch processing techniques to manage resource usage efficiently.
