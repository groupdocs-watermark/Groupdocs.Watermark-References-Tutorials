### License Acquisition Steps
- **Free Trial:** Start with a free trial to test basic functionalities.
- **Temporary License:** Obtain a temporary license for extended access and testing.

#### Basic Initialization
Initialize the `Watermarker` class as shown below:
```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.Watermarker;
import com.groupdocs.watermark.options.EmailLoadOptions;

EmailLoadOptions loadOptions = new EmailLoadOptions();
Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker("input_email.msg", loadOptions);
```

## Implementation Guide

### Feature 1: Search Text in Email Body
This feature enables searching for specific text within an email's subject and body.

#### Overview
We'll demonstrate how to configure GroupDocs.Watermark to search through different parts of an email message using Java code.

##### Step 1: Define Document Paths
Set up your input and output paths for handling emails:
```java
String inputDocumentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/message.msg";
String outputDocumentPath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/output_message.msg";
```

##### Step 2: Set Up Load Options and Watermarker
Initialize the `EmailLoadOptions` and `Watermarker` to work with your email document.
```java
EmailLoadOptions loadOptions = new EmailLoadOptions();
Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(inputDocumentPath, loadOptions);
```

##### Step 3: Create Search Criteria
Define criteria for searching text. We'll use a case-insensitive search for the keyword "test":
```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.search.SearchCriteria;
import com.groupdocs.watermark.search.TextSearchCriteria;

SearchCriteria criteria = new TextSearchCriteria("test", false);
```

##### Step 4: Specify Search Locations
Configure the search to cover both the subject and body of emails:
```java
watermarker.getSearchableObjects().setEmailSearchableObjects(
    EmailSearchableObjects.Subject |
    EmailSearchableObjects.HtmlBody | 
    EmailSearchableObjects.PlainTextBody);
```

##### Step 5: Execute Search and Clear Watermarks
Perform the search and remove any found watermarks:
```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.search.PossibleWatermarkCollection;

PossibleWatermarkCollection watermarks = watermarker.search(criteria);
watermarks.clear();
```

##### Step 6: Save Changes
After processing, save your changes to a new document:
```java
watermarker.save(outputDocumentPath);
// Close the Watermarker instance to release resources
watermarker.close();
```

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Common Issue:** If search results are empty, ensure the text is present in the email body or subject.
- **Performance Tip:** Optimize by limiting searches to necessary sections of emails.

### Feature 2: Load Email Document Options
This section discusses how you can set up additional options when loading an email document for processing with GroupDocs.Watermark.

#### Overview
Configuring load options enables more control over how documents are handled, such as specifying password protection or encoding settings.

##### Step 1: Configure Load Options
Here's a basic setup for `EmailLoadOptions`:
```java
EmailLoadOptions loadOptions = new EmailLoadOptions();
// Additional configurations can be added here.
```

#### Key Configuration Options
- **Password Protection:** Specify passwords if your emails are encrypted.
- **Encoding Settings:** Define specific encoding types as needed.

## Practical Applications

### Use Case 1: Automated Email Processing
Automate the filtering and processing of bulk email data to find specific content efficiently.

### Use Case 2: Legal Compliance Checks
