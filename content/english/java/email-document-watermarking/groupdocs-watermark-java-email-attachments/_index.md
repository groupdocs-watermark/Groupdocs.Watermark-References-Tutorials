Let’s review the prerequisites before we begin!

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, ensure you have:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of Java programming and working with email files.
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

Additionally, set up GroupDocs.Watermark for Java in your project environment. Let's get started!

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Watermark for Java

### Maven Setup

### Basic Initialization

To start using GroupDocs.Watermark for Java, import the necessary libraries:

```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.Watermarker;
// Other imports as needed...
```

## Implementation Guide

Let's break down the process into manageable steps.

### Step 1: Create a Text Watermark

Begin by creating a `TextWatermark` object with your desired font settings. This will be applied to each attachment.

```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.watermarks.Font;
import com.groupdocs.watermark.watermarks.TextWatermark;

// Step 1: Create a text watermark.
TextWatermark watermark = new TextWatermark("Confidential", new Font("Arial", 19));
```

### Step 2: Set Up Email Load Options

Prepare the `EmailLoadOptions` to read the email file.

```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.options.EmailLoadOptions;

// Step 2: Setup the email load options.
EmailLoadOptions loadOptions = new EmailLoadOptions();
```

### Step 3: Initialize Watermarker for Your Email File

Create a `Watermarker` instance using the path to your email file.

```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.Watermarker;

// Step 3: Initialize the watermarker with your email file.
String emailFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/email_file.msg";
Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(emailFilePath, loadOptions);
```

### Step 4: Retrieve Email Content

Access the email content to iterate over its attachments.

```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.contents.EmailContent;

// Step 4: Retrieve the email content.
EmailContent content = watermarker.getContent(EmailContent.class);
```

### Step 5: Iterate Over Attachments

Loop through each attachment and check if it is supported for watermarking.

```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.common.FileType;
import com.groupdocs.watermark.contents.EmailAttachment;
import com.groupdocs.watermark.common.IDocumentInfo;

// Step 5: Process each attachment.
for (EmailAttachment attachment : content.getAttachments()) {
    IDocumentInfo info = attachment.getDocumentInfo();
    
    // Check if file type is supported and not encrypted
    if (info.getFileType() != FileType.Unknown && !info.isEncrypted()) {
        // Proceed with watermarking...
    }
}
```

### Step 6-9: Add Watermark to Supported Attachments

For each eligible attachment, create a new `Watermarker`, apply the watermark, update, and close.

```java
// Step 6: Create a watermarker for the attached document.
Watermarker attachedWatermarker = attachment.createWatermarker();

// Step 7: Apply the text watermark.
attachedWatermarker.add(watermark);

// Step 8: Update with the new content.
attachment.updateContent(attachedWatermarker);

// Step 9: Close the attached watermarker.
attachedWatermarker.close();
```

### Step 10: Save the Watermarked Email

Save your changes to a new file.

```java
// Step 10: Save the modified email.
String outputFilePath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/watermarked_email_file.msg";
watermarker.save(outputFilePath);
```

### Step 11: Clean Up

Finally, close the main `Watermarker` instance.

```java
// Step 11: Close the watermarker for cleanup.
watermarker.close();
```

## Practical Applications

Here are a few real-world use cases:
1. **Internal Document Sharing:** Securely distribute confidential files within an organization by embedding company branding or confidentiality notices.
2. **Client Communications:** Enhance document security when sharing sensitive contracts or proposals with clients.
3. **Email Marketing Campaigns:** Distinguish your branded content from others in marketing campaigns to increase brand recognition.

These applications demonstrate how watermarking can be integrated into existing workflows, enhancing both security and branding.

## Performance Considerations

To ensure optimal performance:
- Use efficient memory management practices.
- Limit the size of attachments being processed if possible.
- Batch process multiple files to reduce overhead.

Understanding these considerations will help maintain smooth operations when using GroupDocs.Watermark in your applications.
