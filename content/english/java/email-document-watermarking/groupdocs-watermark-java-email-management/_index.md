# Email Document Watermarking in Java: Master Management with GroupDocs.Watermark

Managing emails, especially those containing sensitive information or large attachments, can be challenging. **GroupDocs.Watermark for Java** offers a streamlined solution to load, modify, and save email files effectively. This guide will show you how to manage embedded JPEG images within emails using GroupDocs.Watermark, helping maintain cleaner and more secure communications.

### What You'll Learn:
- Loading and initializing a Watermarker for email files
- Accessing and modifying email content
- Saving changes and closing the Watermarker efficiently

Let's get started!

## Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure you have the following:

### Required Libraries and Versions
- **GroupDocs.Watermark** library (version 24.11 or later)
- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher

### Environment Setup
- An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for Java development
- Maven installed on your system to manage dependencies

### Knowledge Prerequisites
A basic understanding of Java programming and familiarity with email file formats will be beneficial.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Watermark for Java
To begin, set up the GroupDocs.Watermark library in your Java project. You can do this through Maven or by downloading directly from their website.

**Maven Setup:**
Add the following configuration to your `pom.xml` file:
```xml
<repositories>
   <repository>
      <id>repository.groupdocs.com</id>
      <name>GroupDocs Repository</name>
      <url>https://releases.groupdocs.com/watermark/java/</url>
   </repository>
</repositories>

<dependencies>
   <dependency>
      <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
      <artifactId>groupdocs-watermark</artifactId>
      <version>24.11</version>
   </dependency>
</dependencies>
```
**Direct Download:**
Alternatively, download the latest version from [GroupDocs.Watermark for Java releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/watermark/java/).

### License Acquisition
- Start with a free trial by downloading the library.
- For extended use, consider obtaining a temporary license or purchasing one.

## Implementation Guide
Now that you have everything set up, let's break down the implementation into key features:

### Load and Initialize Watermarker for Email
**Overview:**
This feature shows how to load an email file and initialize the Watermarker, marking the starting point for any modification.

#### Step 1: Import Necessary Packages
```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.Watermarker;
import com.groupdocs.watermark.options.EmailLoadOptions;
```

#### Step 2: Load the Email File
Initialize `EmailLoadOptions` and create a new Watermarker instance.
```java
EmailLoadOptions loadOptions = new EmailLoadOptions();
Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/message.msg", loadOptions);
```
*Parameters like "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY" need to be replaced with your actual email file path.*

### Access and Modify Email Content
**Overview:**
Learn how to access the content of an email and remove embedded JPEG images, enhancing privacy and reducing unnecessary data.

#### Step 3: Access Embedded Objects
Retrieve and iterate over embedded objects in the email.
```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.contents.EmailContent;

EmailContent content = watermarker.getContent(EmailContent.class);
for (int i = content.getEmbeddedObjects().getCount() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (content.getEmbeddedObjects().get_Item(i).getDocumentInfo().getFileType() == FileType.JPEG) {
        // Explanation: Identify and remove JPEG images to keep the email clean
        String pattern = "<img[^>]*src=\"cid:" + content.getEmbeddedObjects().get_Item(i).getContentId() + "\"[^>]*>";
        content.setHtmlBody(content.getHtmlBody().replaceAll(pattern, ""));
        content.getEmbeddedObjects().removeAt(i);
    }
}
```
*This loop identifies JPEG images and removes their references from the HTML body.*

### Save and Close Watermarker
**Overview:**
Ensure all changes are saved to a new email file before closing the Watermarker.

#### Step 4: Save Changes
```java
watermarker.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/processed_message.msg");
```
*Replace "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY" with your desired save location.*

#### Step 5: Close Watermarker
Properly close the watermarker to release resources.
```java
watermarker.close();
```
