- Adding attachments to an email message programmatically
- Saving changes and closing the watermarked document properly

Let's start with the prerequisites.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Ensure JDK 8 or later is installed on your machine.
2. **Integrated Development Environment (IDE):** Use an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for a smoother experience.
3. **GroupDocs.Watermark Library:** You'll need the GroupDocs.Watermark library to work with email attachments.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Watermark for Java

Setting up your environment is straightforward. Once you have the dependencies in place, initialize GroupDocs.Watermark with ease:

```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.Watermarker;

// Initialize Watermarker
Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker("path/to/your/file.msg");
```

## Implementation Guide

Let's break down each feature step by step.

### Load Email Message

**Overview:** This section demonstrates how to load an email message into memory using GroupDocs.Watermark.

#### Step 1: Import Required Libraries
```java
import java.io.File;
import com.groupdocs.watermark.Watermarker;
import com.groupdocs.watermark.options.EmailLoadOptions;
```

#### Step 2: Set the Path and Load Options

Specify the file path and create a `EmailLoadOptions` object to handle loading specifics.

```java
String emailFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/message.msg";
EmailLoadOptions loadOptions = new EmailLoadOptions();
Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(emailFilePath, loadOptions);
```

At this point, your email message is loaded into memory and ready for manipulation.

### Add Attachment to Email Message

**Overview:** Learn how to add an attachment to a previously loaded email message using GroupDocs.Watermark.

#### Step 1: Prepare the Attachment
```java
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.InputStream;

// Initialize input stream for the attachment file
File attachmentFile = new File("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.msg");
byte[] attachmentBytes = new byte[(int) attachmentFile.length()];
InputStream attachmentInputStream = new FileInputStream(attachmentFile);

// Read bytes from the attachment file
attachmentInputStream.read(attachmentBytes);
attachmentInputStream.close();
```

#### Step 2: Add Attachment to Email Content

Retrieve the email content and add your attachment.

```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.contents.EmailContent;

EmailContent content = watermarker.getContent(EmailContent.class);
content.getAttachments().add(attachmentBytes, "sample.msg");
```
The attachment is now added to the email message.

### Save Changes to Email Message

**Overview:** This section covers how to save your changes and close the Watermarker instance correctly.

#### Step 1: Specify Output Path
```java
String outputFilePath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/modified_message.msg";
```

#### Step 2: Save and Close
```java
watermarker.save(outputFilePath);
watermarker.close();
The modified email message is saved, and resources are released by closing the `Watermarker`.
```

## Practical Applications

- **Email Archiving:** Automate the process of attaching documents to emails for record-keeping.
- **Document Management Systems (DMS):** Enhance DMS by programmatically managing email attachments.
- **Secure Communication:** Add watermarks or digital signatures to email contents and attachments.

Integration with CRM systems can also be achieved, allowing seamless handling of customer communications.

## Performance Considerations

To optimize performance:

- Ensure efficient memory management when dealing with large files.
