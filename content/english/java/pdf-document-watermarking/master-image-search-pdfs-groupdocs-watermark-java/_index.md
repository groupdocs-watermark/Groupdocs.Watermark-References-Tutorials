# Mastering Image Search in PDFs with GroupDocs.Watermark Java

## Introduction

Working with PDFs often involves managing embedded images—whether for editing, extracting, or watermarking purposes. Have you ever wanted to quickly locate specific images within a PDF? With GroupDocs.Watermark for Java, you can effortlessly search, identify, and manipulate images embedded in your PDF documents. This tutorial walks you through the process of mastering image searches in PDFs step-by-step, so you can efficiently handle image-related tasks.

## Prerequisites

Before diving in, ensure you have:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or above installed  
- GroupDocs.Watermark for Java SDK downloaded and configured in your IDE  
- Basic knowledge of Java programming  
- Access to a sample PDF file with embedded images  

Once you’re ready, let's explore how to perform image searches within PDFs using GroupDocs.Watermark.

## Import Required Packages

Start by importing the essential classes:

```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.domain.PdfSearchableObjects;
import com.groupdocs.watermark.domain.watermarkable.PdfImage;
import com.groupdocs.watermark.domain.watermarkable.WatermarkableImageCollection;
import com.groupdocs.watermark.options.PdfLoadOptions;
import com.groupdocs.watermark.Watermarker;
```

### Step 1: Load Your PDF Document

**Why?** To work with your PDF, you first need to load it into the Watermarker object.

**How?**

```java
// Specify the path to your PDF
String inputPdfPath = "C:\\Docs\\sample.pdf";

// Initialize load options
PdfLoadOptions loadOptions = new PdfLoadOptions();

// Create Watermarker instance
Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(inputPdfPath, loadOptions);
```

**Tip:** Make sure the PDF exists at the specified path.

### Step 2: Configure Search for Embedded or Attached Images

**Why?** To focus the search on specific object types like attached images.

**How?**

```java
// Set to search only for attached images
watermarker.getSearchableObjects().setPdfSearchableObjects(PdfSearchableObjects.AttachedImages);
```

This setting tailors the search to images explicitly embedded or attached within the PDF.

### Step 3: Search for Images in the PDF

**Why?** To find all the images that match your search parameters.

**How?**

```java
// Retrieve all images matching the search criteria
WatermarkableImageCollection images = watermarker.getImages();

// Output the number of images found
System.out.println("Number of images found: " + images.getCount());
```

You can process this collection further, such as extracting or editing images.

### Step 4: Process Found Images

**Why?** To manipulate or analyze the images found.

**Example:** Save each image as a separate file

```java
int index = 1;
for (PdfImage image : images) {
    // Save each image as PNG
    image.save("C:\\Output\\Image_" + index + ".png");
    index++;
}
```

### Step 5: Close Resources

Always close the Watermarker to free resources.

```java
watermarker.close();
```

## Extra Tips

- You can customize the search to find only specific images based on size, format, or content.
- Use the API reference for advanced features like replacing images or watermarking found images.
- Test with various PDFs to hone your image search skills.

## Conclusion

Searching for images within PDFs using GroupDocs.Watermark for Java is straightforward once you understand the steps. Load your document, configure search settings, retrieve images, and process them as needed. Mastering this process accelerates document management workflows, makes image editing easier, and enhances automation in your projects.
