#### License Acquisition
- You can start with a **free trial** to explore features.
- Obtain a **temporary license** for extended evaluation or purchase a full license.

### Basic Initialization
After setting up the library, initialize your project by importing necessary classes and preparing your document paths:

```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.Watermarker;
import com.groupdocs.watermark.options.PdfLoadOptions;

// Specify your document directory
String inputPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/document.pdf";
PpdfLoadOptions loadOptions = new PdfLoadOptions();
Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(inputPath, loadOptions);
```

## Implementation Guide
This section walks you through the implementation of adding text and image watermarks to PDFs. We will break it down by feature for clarity.

### Adding a Text Watermark
#### Overview
Text watermarks are ideal for branding or marking documents as drafts. This guide shows how to add a simple, customizable text watermark to your PDF files.

##### Step 1: Load the PDF Document
Begin by loading your target PDF document:

```java
PdfLoadOptions loadOptions = new PdfLoadOptions();
Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/document.pdf", loadOptions);
```

##### Step 2: Create and Configure a Text Watermark
Configure properties like font, size, alignment, and opacity of the text watermark.

```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.common.HorizontalAlignment;
import com.groupdocs.watermark.watermarks.Font;
import com.groupdocs.watermark.watermarks.TextWatermark;

TextWatermark textWatermark = new TextWatermark("This is an artifact watermark", new Font("Arial", 8));
textWatermark.setHorizontalAlignment(HorizontalAlignment.Right);
```

##### Step 3: Add the Text Watermark to the PDF Document
Add the configured watermark to your document.

```java
watermarker.add(textWatermark, null); // Use default options for simplicity
```

##### Step 4: Save and Close the Watermarked PDF
Save changes and release resources:

```java
watermarker.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/out_document.pdf");
watermarker.close();
```

### Adding an Image Watermark
#### Overview
Image watermarks are useful for adding logos or other graphic elements to your documents.

##### Step 1: Load the PDF Document
Reuse the loading process as outlined in the text watermark section.

```java
PdfLoadOptions loadOptions = new PdfLoadOptions();
Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/document.pdf", loadOptions);
```

##### Step 2: Create and Configure an Image Watermark
Initialize your image with the path to the logo or graphic you wish to use as a watermark.

```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.watermarks.ImageWatermark;

ImageWatermark imageWatermark = new ImageWatermark("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/logo.bmp");
```

##### Step 3: Add the Image Watermark to the PDF Document
Insert the image watermark into your document using default settings for simplicity.

```java
watermarker.add(imageWatermark, null);
```

##### Step 4: Close and Save the Watermarked PDF
Ensure you release resources used by the image and save the final document:

```java
imageWatermark.close();
watermarker.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/out_document.pdf");
watermarker.close();
```

## Practical Applications
Integrating GroupDocs.Watermark into your applications can significantly enhance document security across various scenarios:

1. **Legal Documents**: Add watermarks to confidential agreements or contracts.
2. **Educational Materials**: Watermark course materials to prevent unauthorized distribution.
3. **Marketing Collateral**: Brand promotional PDFs with company logos.
4. **Internal Reports**: Mark drafts and internal documents for easy identification.
5. **Subscription Services**: Protect digital content shared with subscribers.

## Performance Considerations
To ensure optimal performance when using GroupDocs.Watermark, consider these tips:

- Use efficient memory management practices to handle large files.
- Optimize watermark settings (size, transparency) to minimize processing time.
- Regularly update the library for improvements and bug fixes.
