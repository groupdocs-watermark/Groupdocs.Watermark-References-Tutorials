# Add Print-Only Watermarks to PDFs Using GroupDocs.Watermark Java: A Comprehensive Guide
## Introduction
In today's digital age, safeguarding printed documents is as crucial as protecting them on-screen. Watermarks serve as invisible guardians, making unauthorized reproduction difficult. By ensuring these protective marks are only visible during printing and not in regular viewing mode, you add another layer of security to your PDFs. This tutorial will guide you through using GroupDocs.Watermark for Java to add print-only annotation watermarks to PDF files.

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to configure a PDF document with a print-only watermark using GroupDocs.Watermark.
- Essential setup steps and prerequisites for getting started with GroupDocs.Watermark in Java.
- Best practices for implementing this feature effectively.

Let’s dive into the prerequisites needed before you begin.
## Prerequisites
Before adding print-only watermarks to your PDFs, ensure you have:
### Required Libraries and Dependencies
- **GroupDocs.Watermark for Java**: Ensure you have version 24.11 or later.
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: A stable JDK is required.
### Environment Setup
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
- Maven installed if managing dependencies via Maven.
### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Java programming concepts.
- Familiarity with PDF file structures and manipulation.
## Setting Up GroupDocs.Watermark for Java
To start using GroupDocs.Watermark, set up your project environment correctly. Below are the steps to include this library in your project.
### Maven Setup
If you're using Maven, add the following configuration to your `pom.xml`:
```xml
<repositories>
   <repository>
      <id>repository.groupdocs.com</id>
      <name>GroupDocs Repository</name>
      <url>https://releases.groupdocs.com/watermark/java/</url>
   </repository>
</repositories>

<dependencies>
   <dependency>
      <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
      <artifactId>groupdocs-watermark</artifactId>
      <version>24.11</version>
   </dependency>
</dependencies>
```
### Direct Download
Alternatively, download the latest version directly from [GroupDocs.Watermark for Java releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/watermark/java/).
### License Acquisition
- **Free Trial**: Start with a free trial to explore features.
- **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license if needed for extended testing.
- **Purchase**: Consider purchasing a full license for production use.
### Basic Initialization and Setup
Create a new Java project in your IDE. Add the GroupDocs.Watermark library as described above, ensuring it's correctly configured within your build path or `pom.xml`.
## Implementation Guide
In this section, we will break down how to add a print-only watermark to a PDF document using GroupDocs.Watermark for Java.
### Step 1: Load Your PDF Document
Start by loading the PDF document you want to watermark. Specify the path to your document directory:
```java
PdfLoadOptions loadOptions = new PdfLoadOptions();
Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/your-document.pdf", loadOptions);
```
**Explanation**: The `PdfLoadOptions` class initializes the loading process, and the `Watermarker` object manages your PDF file.
### Step 2: Create a Text Watermark
Define the watermark text and its font settings:
```java
TextWatermark textWatermark = new TextWatermark("This is a print-only test watermark. It won't appear in view mode.", new Font("Arial", 8));
```
**Explanation**: The `TextWatermark` object specifies what your watermark will say and how it appears (font type, size). This watermark is designated as visible only during printing.
### Step 3: Configure Watermark Options
Configure the watermark options to ensure it's print-only and applied to the first page:
```java
Boolean isPrintOnly = true;
PdfAnnotationWatermarkOptions options = new PdfAnnotationWatermarkOptions();
options.setPageIndex(0);
options.setPrintOnly(isPrintOnly);
```
**Explanation**: `PdfAnnotationWatermarkOptions` allows you to specify where and how the watermark should appear. Setting `setPrintOnly(true)` ensures it’s visible only when printing.
### Step 4: Add the Watermark
Add the configured watermark to your document:
```java
watermarker.add(textWatermark, options);
```
**Explanation**: The `add` method applies the watermark with specified settings to your PDF.
### Step 5: Save and Close
Finally, save your changes and close the watermarker instance:
```java
watermarker.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/your-output-document.pdf");
watermarker.close();
```
**Explanation**: Saving ensures that all changes are written to a new file. Closing the `Watermarker` releases resources.
## Practical Applications
Print-only watermarks can be used in various scenarios, including:
- **Confidential Documents**: Add "Confidential" or "Internal Use Only" watermarks.
- **Legal Contracts**: Mark with version numbers or dates for tracking changes during print reviews.
- **Educational Material**: Ensure that printed course materials are not shared without permission.
## Performance Considerations
When implementing GroupDocs.Watermark, consider the following to optimize performance:
- Manage memory efficiently by closing resources promptly.
- Use specific page indices to limit watermark processing only where needed.
- Test with various document sizes to ensure responsiveness and stability.
## Conclusion
You've learned how to add a print-only annotation watermark to PDFs using GroupDocs.Watermark for Java. This feature is particularly useful for protecting documents during printing while maintaining their integrity in digital formats.
**Next Steps**: Explore more features of GroupDocs.Watermark, such as image watermarks or batch processing capabilities.
