        <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
        <artifactId>groupdocs-watermark</artifactId>
        <version>24.11</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

**Direct Download**
Alternatively, download the latest version from [GroupDocs.Watermark for Java releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/watermark/java/).

### Environment Setup
Ensure you have a compatible JDK installed (Java 8 or later). Set up your IDE to include GroupDocs.Watermark in its classpath.

### Knowledge Prerequisites
Basic understanding of Java programming, file handling, and familiarity with Maven for dependency management will be beneficial.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Watermark for Java
GroupDocs.Watermark is a powerful library that simplifies watermarking documents. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. **Install the Library**
   - If using Maven, ensure your `pom.xml` includes the necessary repository and dependency as shown above.
   - For direct downloads, add the JAR files to your project's build path.

2. **License Acquisition**
   - GroupDocs offers a free trial version that allows you to test its features. Consider applying for a temporary license or purchasing one if you need full access for commercial use. This can be done by visiting their [purchase page](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/).

3. **Basic Initialization**
   - Initialize the `Watermarker` class with your PDF document path and load options:
     
     ```java
     PdfLoadOptions loadOptions = new PdfLoadOptions();
     Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker("input_document.pdf", loadOptions);
     ```

## Adding Text Watermarks to PDF Documents
Text watermarks are ideal for marking documents with copyright notices or company logos.

### Step 1: Load the Document
Start by loading your PDF document into the `Watermarker` object:

```java
PdfLoadOptions loadOptions = new PdfLoadOptions();
String inputPdfPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/input_document.pdf";
Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(inputPdfPath, loadOptions);
```

### Step 2: Create Text Watermark
Define your text watermark with desired font settings and alignment:

```java
TextWatermark textWatermark = new TextWatermark("This is an annotation watermark", new Font("Arial", 8));
textWatermark.setHorizontalAlignment(HorizontalAlignment.Left);
textWatermark.setVerticalAlignment(VerticalAlignment.Top);
```

### Step 3: Add the Watermark
Add the created text watermark to your document:

```java
watermarker.add(textWatermark, new PdfAnnotationWatermarkOptions());
```

### Step 4: Save and Close Resources
Finally, save your watermarked PDF and release resources:

```java
String outputPdfPath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/output_document.pdf";
watermarker.save(outputPdfPath);
textWatermark.close();
watermarker.close();
```

## Adding Image Watermarks to PDF Documents
Image watermarks are perfect for branding documents with logos or other graphics.

### Step 1: Load the Document
Load your PDF document as before:

```java
String inputPdfPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/input_document.pdf";
Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(inputPdfPath, loadOptions);
```

### Step 2: Create Image Watermark
Load an image file and set its alignment:

```java
ImageWatermark imageWatermark = new ImageWatermark("watermark_image.jpg");
imageWatermark.setHorizontalAlignment(HorizontalAlignment.Right);
imageWatermark.setVerticalAlignment(VerticalAlignment.Top);
```

### Step 3: Add the Watermark
Add your image watermark to the document:

```java
watermarker.add(imageWatermark, new PdfAnnotationWatermarkOptions());
```

### Step 4: Save and Close Resources
Save the changes and close all resources:

```java
String outputPdfPath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/output_document.pdf";
watermarker.save(outputPdfPath);
imageWatermark.close();
watermarker.close();
```

## Practical Applications
- **Document Security:** Use watermarks to prevent unauthorized copying of sensitive documents.
- **Branding:** Add company logos or other branding elements to official documents.
- **Version Control:** Mark drafts with specific notes or version numbers for easy identification.

Integration possibilities include automated document processing systems, where watermarks can be applied as part of the workflow.

## Performance Considerations
For optimal performance:
- **Batch Processing:** Process multiple documents in batches if applicable to reduce overhead.
- **Memory Management:** Properly manage resources by closing `Watermarker` and watermark objects after use.
- **Optimize Load Options:** Adjust load options for large PDFs to improve processing time.

## Conclusion
By following this tutorial, you've learned how to add both text and image watermarks to PDF documents using GroupDocs.Watermark in Java. These techniques can be adapted to suit various document management needs, enhancing security, branding, or compliance with organizational standards.

As a next step, consider exploring more advanced features of the GroupDocs library, such as removing watermarks or adding them to other document formats.
