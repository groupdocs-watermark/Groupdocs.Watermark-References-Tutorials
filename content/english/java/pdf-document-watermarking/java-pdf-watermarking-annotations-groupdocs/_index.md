      <id>repository.groupdocs.com</id>
      <name>GroupDocs Repository</name>
      <url>https://releases.groupdocs.com/watermark/java/</url>
   </repository>
</repositories>

<dependencies>
   <dependency>
      <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
      <artifactId>groupdocs-watermark</artifactId>

## Implementation Guide
Now that you have set up your environment, let's implement various features using GroupDocs.Watermark for Java.

### Loading a PDF and Initializing Watermark

#### Overview
Loading a PDF document and initializing the watermarking process is fundamental. This step prepares your file for subsequent modifications.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
**1. Configure Load Options**
Start by configuring load options tailored for PDFs:

```java
PdfLoadOptions loadOptions = new PdfLoadOptions();
```

**2. Create a Watermarker Instance**
Initialize the `Watermarker` with your document path and load options:

```java
String inputPdfPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/your-document.pdf";
Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(inputPdfPath, loadOptions);
```

### Accessing Annotations in PDF Content

#### Overview
Annotations provide context or additional information within a PDF. Here's how to access them.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
**1. Load the Document**
Use the same loading method as above.

**2. Access Annotations from the First Page**
Retrieve annotations using the `Watermarker` instance:

```java
PdfContent pdfContent = watermarker.getContent(PdfContent.class);
for (PdfAnnotation annotation : pdfContent.getPages().get_Item(0).getAnnotations()) {
    // Process each annotation
}
```

### Replacing Text in Annotations with Formatting

#### Overview
Enhance your annotations by replacing text and applying custom formatting.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
**1. Load the Document and Access Annotations**
Follow the previous steps to load the document.

**2. Replace Text and Apply Formatting**
Modify text fragments within annotations:

```java
for (PdfAnnotation annotation : pdfContent.getPages().get_Item(0).getAnnotations()) {
    if (annotation.getText().contains("Test")) {
        annotation.getFormattedTextFragments().clear();

        String newText = "Passed";
        Font font = new Font("Calibri", 19, FontStyle.Bold);
        Color foregroundColor = Color.getRed();
        Color backgroundColor = Color.getAqua();
        annotation.getFormattedTextFragments().add(newText, font, foregroundColor, backgroundColor);
    }
}
```

### Saving the Modified PDF Document

#### Overview
After making modifications, save your changes to preserve them.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
**1. Save the Document**
Ensure you have an active `Watermarker` instance:

```java
String outputPdfPath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/modified-document.pdf";
watermarker.save(outputPdfPath);
```

## Practical Applications
GroupDocs.Watermark can be integrated into various real-world scenarios:
- **Legal Documents**: Add watermarks to legal PDFs for authenticity.
- **Educational Materials**: Protect educational content with annotations and watermarks.
- **Business Reports**: Enhance corporate reports with branding via watermarks.

Consider integrating GroupDocs.Watermark with other systems like document management solutions or cloud storage services for seamless workflows.

## Performance Considerations
To ensure optimal performance:
- Manage memory efficiently by disposing of the `Watermarker` instance after use.
- Use batch processing for large numbers of documents to balance resource usage.
- Leverage multi-threading where possible, but be mindful of Java's thread safety with GroupDocs.Watermark objects.

## Conclusion
By following this guide, you've learned how to effectively load, annotate, modify, and save PDFs using GroupDocs.Watermark for Java. These capabilities can significantly enhance document security and traceability in your projects. 
As next steps, consider exploring more advanced features of the API or integrating it into larger systems.
