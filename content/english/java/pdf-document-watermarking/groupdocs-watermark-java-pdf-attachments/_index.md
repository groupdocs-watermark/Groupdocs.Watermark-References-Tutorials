### Basic Initialization and Setup
Once your environment is ready, initialize GroupDocs.Watermark:
```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.Watermarker;
// Initialize Watermarker with input PDF path and load options.
String inputFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/input_document.pdf";
PdfLoadOptions loadOptions = new PdfLoadOptions();
Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(inputFilePath, loadOptions);
```
## Implementation Guide
### Adding a Text Watermark to Attachments
#### Overview
The primary goal is to add a text watermark to all non-encrypted attachments within a PDF document. This enhances security and identification.
#### Step-by-step Implementation
##### Creating the Watermark
```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.watermarks.TextWatermark;
import com.groupdocs.watermark.common.Font;
// Create a TextWatermark with specific content and font settings.
TextWatermark watermark = new TextWatermark("This is WaterMark on Attachment", new Font("Arial", 19));
```
##### Processing PDF Attachments
```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.contents.PdfContent;
import com.groupdocs.watermark.contents.PdfAttachment;
// Access the PDF content and iterate through attachments.
PdfContent pdfContent = watermarker.getContent(PdfContent.class);
for (PdfAttachment attachment : pdfContent.getAttachments()) {
    // Check if the file type is supported and not encrypted.
    IDocumentInfo info = attachment.getDocumentInfo();
    if (info.getFileType() != FileType.Unknown && !info.isEncrypted()) {
        Watermarker attachedWatermarker = attachment.createWatermarker();

        // Add watermark to each valid attachment.
        attachedWatermarker.add(watermark);
        
        // Update and save the content of the attachment with the new watermark.
        attachment.updateContent(attachedWatermarker);

        // Close the watermarker instance for resource management.
        attachedWatermarker.close();
    }
}
```
##### Saving Changes
```java
// Define output file path and save changes to the main document.
String outputFilePath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/output_document.pdf";
watermarker.save(outputFilePath);
watermarker.close();  // Release resources by closing watermarker.
```
### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure attachments are non-encrypted and supported file types.
- Verify paths for input and output files.
## Practical Applications
1. **Document Security**: Adding unique identifiers to sensitive documents shared across platforms.
2. **Branding**: Embed company logos or names in confidential PDFs before distribution.
3. **Version Control**: Mark drafts with version numbers during the review process.
4. **Integration with CMS**: Automate watermarking for content management systems managing large document libraries.
5. **Legal Documentation**: Securely mark legal documents with client-specific information.
## Performance Considerations
- Use optimized fonts and image sizes to reduce processing time.
- Manage memory by closing watermarker instances promptly after use.
- For bulk processing, consider parallel execution where possible.
