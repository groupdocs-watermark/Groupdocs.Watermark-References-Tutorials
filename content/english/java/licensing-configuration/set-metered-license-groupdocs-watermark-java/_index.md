    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        License license = new License();
        // Apply the license using your path to the license file
        license.setLicense("path/to/your/license/file.lic");
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Setting a Metered License

**Overview:**
This feature allows you to set up a metered license for GroupDocs.Watermark, enabling usage tracking and control.

#### Step 1: Define the Public and Private Keys

Firstly, use your public and private keys provided upon acquiring your metered license:

```java
// Step 1: Define the public and private keys for the metered license.
String publicKey = "*****"; // Replace with your actual public key
String privateKey = "*****"; // Replace with your actual private key
```

**Why?**
These keys authenticate your application's access to GroupDocs.Watermark services, ensuring secure usage tracking.

#### Step 2: Create an Instance of the Metered Class

```java
// Step 2: Create an instance of Metered class.
Metered metered = new Metered();
```
The `Metered` class manages your application's licensing status and tracks usage.

#### Step 3: Set the Metered License Using Provided Keys

Finally, set up your license with the keys you obtained:

```java
// Step 3: Set the metered license using the provided keys.
metered.setMeteredKey(publicKey, privateKey);
```
**Why?**
This step is crucial for enabling metered licensing, allowing you to monitor and control how your application uses GroupDocs.Watermark.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure that your public and private keys are correct. Any typo will result in failed authentication.
- If experiencing issues with license activation, double-check the path to your license file during initialization.
