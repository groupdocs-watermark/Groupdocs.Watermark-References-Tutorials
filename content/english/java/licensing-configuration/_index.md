# Set GroupDocs License Java – Watermark Licensing Guide

If you’re integrating **GroupDocs.Watermark** into a Java application, the first step is to **set GroupDocs license Java** correctly. Without a valid license, the API runs in trial mode, which limits functionality and adds watermarks to processed documents. This guide explains why licensing matters, outlines the benefits of proper configuration, and points you to the detailed tutorials you’ll need to get up and running quickly.

## Why set GroupDocs license Java matters?

Setting the license not only unlocks the full feature set—such as high‑resolution watermark rendering, batch processing, and support for a wide range of file formats—but also ensures compliance with GroupDocs’ licensing terms. Proper licensing improves performance, removes trial watermarks, and gives you access to premium support.

## What you’ll find in the detailed tutorials

Below are the two core tutorials that walk you through every licensing scenario, from simple file‑based licensing to stream‑based and metered licensing approaches.
