# How to Add Text Watermarks to Word Documents Using GroupDocs.Watermark for Java

## Introduction

Watermarking documents is crucial for protecting content from unauthorized use or marking a document as draft or confidential. With **GroupDocs.Watermark for Java**, adding watermarks to your Word documents becomes straightforward, ensuring document integrity during distribution.

This tutorial focuses on using **GroupDocs.Watermark for Java** to add text watermarks specifically to section headers within Word documents. By the end of this guide, you will have learned how to:
