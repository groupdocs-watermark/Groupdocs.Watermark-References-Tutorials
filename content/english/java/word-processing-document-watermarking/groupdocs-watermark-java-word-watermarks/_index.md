## Implementation Guide

### Adding Watermarks to Word Documents

#### Overview
This feature demonstrates how to add text watermarks with specific shape settings to a Word document. You'll learn how to customize font, alignment, rotation, color, and opacity of the watermark.

#### Step-by-Step Guide

##### Load the Document
First, load your Word document using `WordProcessingLoadOptions`:

```java
String inputDocumentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/document.docx";
WordProcessingLoadOptions loadOptions = new WordProcessingLoadOptions();
Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(inputDocumentPath, loadOptions);
```

##### Create and Configure the Text Watermark
Create a text watermark with custom font settings. Customize its alignment, rotation angle, color, and opacity:

```java
TextWatermark watermark = new TextWatermark("Test watermark", new Font("Arial", 19));
watermark.setVerticalAlignment(VerticalAlignment.Center);
watermark.setHorizontalAlignment(HorizontalAlignment.Center);
watermark.setRotateAngle(25.0); // Rotate by 25 degrees for a dynamic look.
watermark.setForegroundColor(Color.getRed()); // Red color for visibility.
watermark.setOpacity(1.0); // Full opacity ensures the watermark is prominent.
```

##### Add Watermark with Section-Specific Options
Configure section-specific options and add the watermark to your document:

```java
WordProcessingWatermarkSectionOptions options = new WordProcessingWatermarkSectionOptions();
options.setName("Shape 1");
options.setAlternativeText("Test watermark");

watermarker.add(watermark, options);
```

##### Save the Watermarked Document
Finally, save your changes and close the watermarker to free resources:

```java
String outputDocumentPath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/output_document.docx";
watermarker.save(outputDocumentPath);
watermarker.close();
```

### Aligning and Appearing Text Watermarks

#### Overview
This feature focuses on configuring alignment and appearance settings for text watermarks in Word documents.

##### Add Watermark without Section-Specific Options
For simpler use cases, you can add the watermark without section-specific options:

```java
watermarker.add(watermark); // Directly add the watermark.
```

## Practical Applications

1. **Protecting Drafts**: Use watermarks to mark drafts or confidential documents shared within teams.
2. **Branding Documents**: Add your company logo or tagline as a watermark for branding purposes.
3. **Legal Documentation**: Ensure legal documents carry consistent identifiers across all versions.
4. **Educational Materials**: Prevent unauthorized distribution of educational content by adding watermarks.

## Performance Considerations

When working with large documents, consider these tips:
- Optimize memory usage by disposing of objects promptly using `watermarker.close()`.
- Use watermarking only when necessary to reduce processing time.
- Ensure your environment has sufficient resources to handle document manipulations smoothly.
