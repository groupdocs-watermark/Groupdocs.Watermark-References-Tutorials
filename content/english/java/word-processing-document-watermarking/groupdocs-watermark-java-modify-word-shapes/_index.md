Loading a Word document is the first step to accessing its content. With GroupDocs.Watermark, you can easily configure load options for enhanced control over the process.

```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.Watermarker;
import com.groupdocs.watermark.options.WordProcessingLoadOptions;

// Configure load options for the Word document

// Load the Word document from a specified path
Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/document.docx", loadOptions);
```

#### Explanation
- **WordProcessingLoadOptions**: Configures how your document is loaded, providing flexibility for different scenarios.
- **watermarker**: An instance of `Watermarker` that manages the loading and processing of documents.

### Access Document Content

#### Overview
Accessing content within a Word document allows you to retrieve and manipulate its elements. GroupDocs.Watermark offers a straightforward way to access this content.

```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.contents.WordProcessingContent;

// Get the content of the document as WordProcessingContent
WordProcessingContent content = watermarker.getContent(WordProcessingContent.class);
```

#### Explanation
- **WordProcessingContent**: Represents the content of your Word document, enabling you to interact with its elements like shapes and sections.

### Modify Text in Shapes

#### Overview
Modify text within specific shapes by iterating through their contents. This feature is particularly useful for updating graphical elements without altering the entire document.

```java
import com.groupdocs.watermark.contents.WordProcessingShape;

// Iterate through all shapes in the first section of the document
for (WordProcessingShape shape : content.getSections().get_Item(0).getShapes()) {
    // Check if the shape contains the target text
    if (shape.getText().contains("Some text")) {
        // Replace the text with new text
        shape.setText("Another text");
    }
}
```

#### Explanation
- **WordProcessingShape**: Represents individual shapes within your document.
- **getShapes()**: Returns a collection of shapes, allowing you to iterate and modify them as needed.

### Save and Close Document

#### Overview
After modifications, ensure to save changes and properly close the `Watermarker` resource to free up any associated memory resources.

```java
// Save the modified document to a specified path
watermarker.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/document.docx");

// Close the Watermarker resource to release any associated resources
watermarker.close();
```

#### Explanation
